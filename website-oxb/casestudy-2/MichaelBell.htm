<h2>About the author Michael Fitzhugh Bell</h2>

<p class="text">
    Michael F. Bell is a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America. He is a classically trained chef who has worked in hotels in Austria and has worked in some very well-known restaurants and hotels in America. He spent several years working in the entertainment business in Hollywood, California, as a motion picture catering chef and aspiring screenwriter. He also trains for and does high altitude mountaineering, climbing big peaks around the world.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Michael has written articles for Palm Springs Life magazine and won several writing contests while at prep school and college. His book, The Invisible Crime, was written after seven years of exhausting research. Michael is considered a targeted individual. His book was written for two reasons: to make the American public aware of this technology and the unconscionable crimes for which it is used, and to help other targeted individuals gain control of their lives and cope with this nightmare from which they never seem to wake.

<h2>Book preview</h2>

<p class="text">
    What happens when a typical,
    upper-middle-class man
    from a respectable American family
    becomes the target
    of a covert organization
    bent on controlling both mind and body?
    When that secret organization is armed
    with high-tech weaponry
    which includes microchip technology
    aimed at controlling the minds and actions of its victims,
    terror reigns.
    <span class="stift">In this chilling, true-life account, writer Michael Fitzhugh Bell is drugged, abducted, raped, and surgically implanted with microchips.</span>
    Tracked and tortured,
    Michael&rsquo;s predators can even read his thoughts.
    In this battle of man versus technology turned against us,
    Michael must prove his case to the police
    before his attackers not only eliminate Michael&rsquo;s memory
    &mdash;
    but eliminate Michael.
    From the terror of being electronically stalked
    to the horror of surgical microchip implants and mind control,
    Michael Fitzhugh Bell&rsquo;s experiences as a victim
    will leave you shocked and amazed.
    His uphill battle with doctors,
    lawyers, police, Government, F.B.I., C.I.A.,
    and a secret criminal underworld
    begins in Hollywood,
    races into and through the North Carolina backwoods,
    and then back to California.
</p>

<p class="text">
    As you experience Michael&rsquo;s journey on each horrific page,
    you will see actual medical photos,
    X-rays, ultrasound and MRI images,
    all showing non-therapeutic tracking and torture devices.
    These instruments and tools are available to anyone on the Internet,
    including criminal organizations
    like those which targeted Michael Bell.
    His battle for survival continues today.
    Are you prepared?
