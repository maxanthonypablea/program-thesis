<h1>
    CHARGE OF HOLOCAUST: MEDICAL EXPERIMENT ON BLACK INMATE
</h1>

<p class="text">
    SCI&ndash;FACT &mdash; NOT FICTION: High&ndash;Tech Slavery Is Here
</p>

<p class="text">
    by Maitefa Angaza
</p>

<p class="text">
    It reads like a futuristic horror story:
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;Invasion of the brain snatchers&rdquo;</i>;
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;Black man vs. Yacub, the mad scientist in a battle for the last frontier &mdash; his own inner space.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    The reality is a present-day horror story
    in which some medical professionals apparently feel
    subhuman violation is acceptable
    and basic human rights are negligible.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Brian Wronge,
    a 33&ndash;year&ndash;old Black Brooklyn resident
    originally from Guyana,
    charges that surgeons
    at Billy Seaton Hospital in Staten Island
    illegally, and without his knowledge,
    implanted paramagnetic computer chips
    in his head and body in October 1987.
</p>

<p class="text">
    He has filed a suit in Eastern District Court,
    charging the U.S. government
    with conspiracy to commit murder
    and invasion of privacy
    for including him in what he believes to be
    an experimental surveillance and behavioral study program
    victimizing inmates and, possibly, other members of the population.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Wronge&rsquo;s story starts in 1979,
    when he was arrested
    in connection with the armed robbery
    of the Ozone Layer, a Brooklyn disco &mdash;
    a crime he claims he did not commit.
</p>

<p class="text">
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;Some people I was known to be affiliated with from the neighborhood were arrested and charged in connection with this incident,&rdquo;</i> he said.
</p>

<p class="text">
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;A few days later, I heard the police were looking for me, so I went down to the 67th Precinct on my own to find out what the wanted.&rdquo;</i>
    He was put into a lineup, arrested, convicted,
    offered to plea&ndash;bargain for 1&ndash;1/3 to 3&ndash;1/3 years.
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;Being that I had nothing to do with the crime, I refused. And at the time I was 2&ndash;1/2 years into a five-year probation for an armed robbery which I admitted I had done when I was 18 years old.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    Wronge maintained his innocence
    and was convicted of armed robbery
    and assault in the third degree
    and sentenced to 7&ndash;1/2 to 15 years in prison.
    He was sent to Elmira Correctional Facility
    and remained there for four years,
    during which time be obtained an associate&rsquo;s degree
    at Corning Community College&rsquo;s Behind the Walls Program.
</p>

<p class="text">
    It was at Elmira
    that his scientific aptitude was first noticed.
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;In my first semester, I wrote a paper for Professor Aaronson&rsquo;s Psych 101 class illustrating how the human senses can be imitated using computer analog devices,&rdquo;</i>
    Wronge recalled.
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;I received the highest grade on my paper and I let a few correction officers read it. The next thing you know, I&rsquo;m having problems at the facility.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    He was soon transferred
    to the Arthur Kill Correctional Facility,
    where he remained for three years.
    While there, he was involved in a dispute
    with a correction officer
    who later was rumored
    to have put a prison
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;contract&rdquo;</i>
    out on him.
    Wronge was again transferred,
    this time ostensibly for his own protection,
    to Fishkill Correctional Facility,
    a high-security prison formerly called Matewan,
    when it was devoted
    to the incarceration of the criminally insane.
</p>

<p class="text">
    (Over the next four years,
    until his release,
    Wronge was shuffled back and forth
    to several prisons and psychiatric facilities
    in an attempt, he believes,
    to build a criminal and psychiatric
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;profile&rdquo;</i>
    on him
    and discredit any charges he might make in the future.)
</p>

<h2>
    Short Hospital Stay Begins Long Nightmare
</h2>

<p class="text">
    While at Fishkill,
    Wronge suddenly began experiencing breathing difficulty.
    He suspects that because he was isolated
    from the rest of the prison population at the time,
    his food may have been tampered with
    to induce his symptoms.
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;I was in good health,&rdquo;</i>
    he said.
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;I used to work out with weights and I had no problem with breathing. A chest X&ndash;ray was done and the results were negative, with no indication of lung problems.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    But, Wronge claims, Dr. Vincent Tarantola
    of the pulmonary clinic
    at Billy Seaton Hospital
    convinced him of the need for a bronchoscopy,
    a diagnostic procedure
    designed to detect problems in the lungs.
    Wronge decided to enter the hospital
    to undergo the procedure.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Though patients are usually given
    only a local anesthetic for this procedure,
    he was
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;knocked out completely&rdquo;</i>
    and awoke on a respirator and intravenous equipment.
    The pain at the back of his throat, he assumed,
    resulted from the bronchoscopy.
    The surgeons told him
    he had suffered cardiac arrest
    during the procedure,
    and that the equipment had been used
    to stabilize him.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Following the hospital incident,
    it quickly became apparent to Wronge
    that something was terribly amiss.
    He experienced a host of physical disturbances,
    including dizziness, nausea, incontinence and headaches,
    along with an inability to sleep.
    He was suspicious
    that his body had somehow been tampered with.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Some of his symptoms abated over the next few years,
    Wronge said,
    but he claims
    that curious things continue to happen sporadically.
    At times he would hear a mechanical&ndash;sounding voice
    in his ears
    repeatedly saying things like
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;Your mother doesn&rsquo;t love you&rdquo;</i>
    or
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;Your entire family will be killed.&rdquo;</i>
    At other times
    he suddenly would begin to perspire profusely
    for no apparent reason.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Wronge said he began to suspect
    that whatever had been done to him
    was for the purpose of experimentation and observation.
    And because he wasn&rsquo;t reacting
    in quite the way he suspects they anticipated,
    Wronge became fearful
    that they would harm him
    to prevent him from exposing
    what had been done to him.
</p>

<p class="text">
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;I was trying to get out of there. I knew I was truly in the belly of the beast. I started calling my family up to tell them to get me out of there.&rdquo;</i>
    He was released from prison in May 1989.
</p>

<p class="text">
    According to Wronge,
    a side effect of the implantation
    at that time
    was short&ndash;term memory loss.
    Because he had difficulty in remembering things
    like dates and appointments,
    he found himself back in prison in September,
    serving nine months
    for violation of parole
    &mdash; 30 days at Rikers Island,
    and back to Elmira for the remaining time.
</p>

<h2>
    The Search Begins
</h2>

<p class="text">
    Wronge took the opportunity
    of being back at Elmira
    to do some investigation.
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;Because I worked as an inmate liaison, I had access to the grievance committee files,&rdquo;</i>
    he said.
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;I saw several documents detailing complaints from inmates about the discomfort they were experiencing in their ears and oral pharynx &mdash; that is, the area at the back of the throat. They had sense enough to know that something had been done to them, but almost uniformly, they were sent to the &lsquo;satellite unit,&rsquo; an area of isolation supposedly for mentally unstable inmates.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    Armed with the knowledge
    that he was not alone in his suspicions,
    Wronge began looking into his own case
    immediately upon his release.
    He went to see Dr. Albert O. Duncan,
    a physician acquainted with his brother,
    who wrote him a prescription for MRI &mdash;
    a type of X&ndash;ray.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Diagnostic Imaging Associates,
    a Brooklyn lab,
    reported back:
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;MRI of the chest was performed. ... These images reveal the presence of a paramagnetic foreign body artifact noted in the region of the left anterior chest wall at the level of the axilla ...&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    Wronge also consulted a neurologist
    who had worked with his mother, Dr. Jayesh Kamdar.
    After relating his story,
    Kamdar referred him
    to a Manhattan diagnostic lab for a CAT scan.
</p>

<p class="text">
    The resulting report from MRI&ndash;CT Scanning Inc. revealed:
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;The bilateral external auditory canals demonstrate dense rectangular shaped metal foreign objects. The etiology of this finding is uncertain. Clinical correlation is suggested.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    After reviewing the lab reports, Wronge says,
    Duncan offered to refer him
    to a few physicians
    who could remove the implants for him,
    but Wronge did not have sufficient funds
    to cover such an operation at the time.
    He was relieved, however,
    to have his X&ndash;rays and lab reports in hand,
    proof that he was not delusional,
    as he believes prison authorities had attempted
    to set him up to appear.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Ironically,
    it was Wronge&rsquo;s poor financial status
    that led him to another discovery.
    He had been frustrated
    by his seeming inability to secure employment,
    a fact he attributed to the record
    of prison transfers and psychiatric evaluations
    that traveled with him
    after his release from prison.
</p>

<p class="text">
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;So I figured, what the hell? I wasn&rsquo;t working and they were playing games, so I decided to file for disability through SSI (Supplemental Security Income). I got a letter back from the federal government saying that I did not qualify because they had contacted the psychiatric facilities in which I had stayed and my claims that I had been found incompetent could not be corroborated.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    This startling piece of information
    made it clear to Wronge
    that prison officials
    and medical personnel had,
    in fact,
    sent him to these facilities
    solely for the purposes
    he had suspected.
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;They tried to destroy my head and then make it look like I was the one who was crazy if I attempted to expose them,&rdquo;</i>
    he said.
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;We all know if you go around saying you hear voices &mdash; immediately you&rsquo;re a nut. It&rsquo;s set up that way.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<h2>
    A Physician Verifies Wronge&rsquo;s Suspicions
</h2>

<p class="text">
    In his quest to find someone
    who would listen
    and try to help him,
    Wronge was referred
    to the Rev. Phil Valentine,
    director of the Institute for Self&ndash;Mastery
    and a
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;nature healing&rdquo;</i>
    consultant
    and fasting therapist.
    Valentine was touched and angered
    by Wronge&rsquo;s story, though,
    like most who hear it,
    his first reaction was
    not to want to believe
    that such a bestial thing had been done.
</p>

<p class="text">
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;Brian seems to be the &lsquo;spook who sat by the door,&rsquo; the one who slipped away and kept his sanity. He is completely articulate, he&rsquo;s documented his case and his credibility earns him the right to be heard,&rdquo;</i>
    Valentine said.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Valentine invited Wronge
    to share his story
    with a few members of the community
    and Wronge accepted.
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;He came in and sat down with his proof and for an hour he had us frozen with shock and foreboding. We always believed they were capable of this type of thing and were probably gearing up for it, but to see it before you is quite chilling,&rdquo;</i>
    he said.
</p>

<p class="text">
    An anatomist
    (a physician specializing in the study of the body)
    was asked by Valentine
    to meet and examine Wronge.
    A videotaped interview with Wronge
    also was prepared the same day.
</p>

<p class="text">
    The physician,
    who wishes to remain anonymous
    at this time,
    looked into Wronge&rsquo;s ears
    with an otoscope
    and allowed Valentine to look also.
</p>

<p class="text">
    The doctor reports
    seeing
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;a flat metallic object, like a computer chip, covering a portion of his eardrum. Where I should have been able to see straight through to his entire eardrum, this object was obstructing my view. It was a little off to the side like a spare drum.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    Valentine described
    what he saw as
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;a prosthetic material, which appeared both metallic and translucent. When the light hit it you could see spots of pink and other faint colors. It was a round, shiny little thing embedded in the membrane of his eardrum, with a little thing sticking out like an antenna. My heart sank and I became cold.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    When asked
    what the purpose of positioning a computer chip
    in that location would be,
    the doctor replied:
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;To pick up and transmit sound. With a device in that location one could hear what is said to a person and have them hear what you might say to them.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    The anatomist,
    at the suggestion of Valentine,
    then asked the videographer
    for use of a hand&ndash;held microphone.
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;When I passed the microphone over his body, it picked up vibration and &lsquo;white noise&rsquo; &mdash; sound waves that would be emitted by computer chips,&rdquo;</i>
    the doctor said.
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;This happened in the area under his arm, near his forehead and in some places along the vertebral column.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;When we had been doing this for a minute or so, the sound suddenly dropped as though someone had turned down the frequency somewhere. These chips are probably operated by some transmitter station that the body sends sound waves out to.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    The doctor feels it is,
    of course,
    obvious that a medically trained person did this.
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;They know where the rootlets come out of the spinal cord, and the underarm was chosen because it is located along the channel where the nerves come out of the tracheal plexus and go into the arm. There is a heavy enervation there with electrical impulses and neuronal transport impulses. Something artificial could easily interfere with the current, producing a human radio.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    About Wronge&rsquo;s X&ndash;rays,
    the doctor said,
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;There are certain sinuses in the bone, grooves where something is implanted in the maxillary area.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    The City Sun inquired
    about Wronge&rsquo;s assertion
    that a disk of some type
    appeared to be lodged
    in the back of his throat.
    Our anonymous physician said,
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;I was not able to examine his throat with the equipment I had at the time, but that is certainly a plausible theory. The larynx is a tube that opens and closes depending on pitch. I suspect they can open the membrane and insert a chip right there where the voice box is located.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    This would enable someone
    on the other end of a microwave transmission
    to monitor Wronge&rsquo;s speech
    and even thoughts,
    said the doctor.
    Our thoughts are registered
    in very high&ndash;pitched frequency
    on the voice box.
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;Remember that saying, &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t go to jail for what you think&rsquo;? Well, not anymore,&rdquo;</i>
    said the doctor.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Valentine agrees,
    and feels
    that people of African descent
    must remain awake
    and willing to examine painful possibilities.
    Considering the makeup of the prison population
    and plans for more prison barges
    and facilities of all types,
    this is imperative, he asserts.
</p>

<p class="text">
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t wait for the white man to tell us whether or not we have a suspicion,&rdquo;</i>
    he said.
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;That second-class mentality that feels that nothing is legitimate until it has been validated by the government or the mainstream media is suicidal. They prepare us for these types of things by putting them in movies like Total Recall, where Arnold Schwarzenegger discovers he&rsquo;s been implanted and removes the device through his nose. Then, when they gradually make the public aware that these things exist, we are supposed to think, &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s OK. That&rsquo;s a technological advance I saw in the movies.&rsquo;&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;We must stop reacting and gain the courage to act. African scientists, medical professionals and researchers of integrity must come forth to help this bother for all our sakes.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<h2>
    Wronge&rsquo;s Case Is Our Case
</h2>

<p class="text">
    Brian Wronge is attempting
    to bring his violators to justice.
    He says a New York state Supreme Court judge
    has agreed to hear the case.
    However, the judge has Wronge&rsquo;s case on hold
    and has instructed him
    to find a surgeon
    to remove one of the chips
    and an independent scientific researcher
    who will identify it
    and what function it performs.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Wronge consulted with a surgeon
    who prefers to be identified
    only as
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;a well&ndash;trained surgeon at one of the reputable institutions in New York City.&rdquo;</i>
    This surgeon,
    recommended to Wronge by a friend,
    was helpful
    but turned out
    not to be able
    to provide the assistance
    he most immediately was seeking.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Wronge had decided to try
    to have one of the chips in his ear removed,
    as they would be most accessible.
    But the doctor he consulted
    was not an ear, nose and throat surgeon.
    He did examine Wronge&rsquo;s X&ndash;rays
    and agreed to speak briefly
    with The City Sun
    about his opinion of them.
</p>

<p class="text">
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;My impression is that there is a foreign object in his ear. I&rsquo;m not sure what it is. ... It&rsquo;s very unusual in appearance but definitely appears to be either metallic or made of some sort of alloy. I can only conjecture from seeing it only on X&ndash;ray, and from what Mr. Wronge has told me, that it may be some sort of electrical instrument or prosthetic device. A prosthetic device, however, is usually employed to replace a damaged element of the body. If he&rsquo;s never had a need for such a device, it should not be there, and certainly not without his knowledge.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    Wronge intends to persevere
    with his case.
    He believes he knows
    what has been done to him
    and how and why.
    He has always been science- and technology&ndash;literate,
    and after his release from prison,
    he read voraciously on biology,
    psychological studies
    and the applications of microwave technology.
</p>

<p class="text">
    He said,
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;I believe they are experimenting with people in prisons and mental institutions to see how they react to psychological trauma. Young Black males particularly are targeted and brought into the penal system for political and other reasons. Once they have you in the government&rsquo;s custody, they can do these biological and psychological studies.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    He believes
    some of the implantation
    was done
    through an incision
    made at the back of his throat,
    causing the pain
    he experienced
    after he awoke in the hospital.
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;Through the throat they can pass objects down to your chest cavity, and further.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    In his studies
    Wronge claims to have gained knowledge of
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;a gallium scan that can map the centers of the brain and, along with a transmitter attached to your nervous system, can transmit signals from the brain that go from analog to satellite.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    At this point,
    Wronge is representing himself,
    though he does realize
    he will need to find an attorney
    willing to represent him
    before his case proceeds.
    He says that he has spoken
    to a few attorneys,
    but
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;they took at it initially because they see financial potential in it, but they don&rsquo;t want to touch it because it&rsquo;s too controversial.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    When asked about his concerns
    for his personal safety,
    Wronge said,
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;They have disrespected my temple and for all I know, may have tried to kill me. I&rsquo;m a soldier at war.&rdquo;</i>
    He said
    that his family has been notified
    of his suspicions
    and knows what to do
    should some harm come to him.
</p>

<p class="text">
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;A person&rsquo;s family automatically has rights to the body of the deceased, and no medical examiner has the right to touch a body without the permission of the family. Whoever does something to me has to take my body also, because it contains evidence. If my family were to say, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t touch that body, we want an autopsy done to examine his brain,&rsquo; they&rsquo;re going to find what&rsquo;s there. Believe me, the government doesn&rsquo;t want that.&rdquo;</i>
</p>
