        Hello Huylebroeck Cliff
    </p>

    <p class="text">
        I would like to help, but i have a lot of important TI related projects at the moment.
        The "to do list" gets longer every day.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
        if possible i would prefer only to translate parts of it.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
        By the way,
        I have been looking for Danish TI's
        for the last two years,
        so far i have only found 3,
        and they all seem to be afraid,
        and don't seem like
        they want to actively work
        on the TI Issue to expose it.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
        I have not heard about J&oslash;rgen Christiansen before,
        so i would be happy
        if you could refer him to me,
        or otherwise establish a contact between us.

        <b>Biography of Lars Drudgaard</b>
    </p>

    <p class="oymireland">
        Education:
    </p>

    <p class="oymireland">
        - AP. P. in Electronic Development Engineering and Technology, O.T.S.
    </p>

    <p class="oymireland">
        - Graduated as a Sound Engineer and Audio Designer, Danmedia/Music Academy
    </p>

    <p class="oymireland">
        - Partly finished education in Audiology.O.T.S/K.T.S.
    </p>

    <p class="oymireland">
        Lars is from Denmark in Europe.
        For the last 15 years
        he has worked
        in many fields of Sound engineering,
        at Radio/TV broadcast stations,
        in music studios
        both as a sound engineer and producer
        and has thought sound engineering and audio design.
        After 10 years in the Rock&acute;n Roll Industry,
        he decided to scale this down
        in favor of a full time job
        at the Danish association of the Blind.
        Apart from the daily audiobook productions,
        he worked with the implementation
        of the digital navigational DAISY format
        throughout the organization.
        He was also involved in projects
        involving the implementation of &ldquo;audio description&rdquo;
        for TV and Cinema.
        He didn&rsquo;t quit music completely
        but limited it to 1-4 times a month
        at Denmark&rsquo;s most prestigious modern music venue,
        VEGA
        where he worked as a sound engineer
        and in-house technician.
    </p>

    <p class="oymireland">
        In recent years
        he has used his spare time
        on inventions
        in the field of professional sound engineering and audiology.
    </p>

    <p class="oymireland">
        Case Story very Short:
    </p>

    <p class="oymireland">
        Due to the International Financial crisis,
        donations for the Danish Association of the blind where decreasing,
        and in December 2008
        it was announced
        that they would have to lay of several jobs,
        a colleague presented me
        with a job ad
        that matched my technical background.
        The Danish Military Intelligence service
        was looking for personnel
        with the exact Electronics education that i had.
        I applied for the job in January 2009,
        just around the same time,
        when the Danish Prime-minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen,
        was putting in his bet
        to become NATO general secretary.
    </p>

    <p class="oymireland">
        I started to take notice of surveillance.
        Towards the end of February 2009,
        i got a reply from the Military Intelligence Service.
        I was rejected for the job,
        but the surveillance increased
        instead of going away.
        Towards the end of may 2009
        i got a good insight
        into the nature of the surveillance system
        and how it worked,
        and shortly after that
        i was subjected to an assassination attempt.
        Undisclosed sources have since stated
        that it was possibly an attempt
        for extraordinary rendition.
        In the same period the perpetrators,
        also managed to steal one of my inventions.
    </p>

    <p class="oymireland">
        I reported the my story
        to the police in Copenhagen,
        who advised me
        to contact the Danish Chief of police.
        The reply i got from the Danish Chief of Police
        was that he was not authorized
        to make an investigation into my case.
    </p>

    <p class="oymireland">
        What followed was a couple of years
        of extreme psychological torture
        which culminated in 2010
        with the attempt to program me
        to become an Indiscriminately killing Manchurian Candidate,
        Where even children would not be spared.
        Apparently the whole thing was revealed
        behind the scenes
        and in Autumn 2010
        someone intervened
        and the torture program stopped,
        and a phase of deprogramming was initiated.
        Since that time
        it has been Harassment and surveillance.
        In January 2011
        i became active in the international community,
        to expose these crimes against humanity.
    </p>

    <p class="oymireland">
        I started an International Skype call,
        that lead to the forming of ICAACT
        when Jesse Beltran came into the meetings
        in autumn 2011.
    </p>

    <p class="oymireland">
        The work with ICAACT
        has been my focus ever since.
    </p>
</div>

<p class="text">
    So he&rsquo;s a sound technician,
    AP. P. in Electronics Technology.
    <br>
    This contains also his cover story:
    he fears that he will be accused
    of being the secret service,
    so he makes up a story
    that says
    that he wanted to join them
    but they didn&rsquo;t want him.

        Biography of Lars Drudgaard (European Contact)

        Education:

        <br>
        - Partly finished education in Audiology.O.T.S/K.T.S.
        <br>
        - After he finished his Draft
        as a squad leader in a Signals/Specials(Hazmat) unit,
        he was asked to join the local police force
        where he served 10 years
        as a squad leader on &ldquo;on call duty&rdquo;.

        Lars is from Denmark in Europe.
        For the last 15 years
        he has worked in many fields of Sound engineering,

    </p>

<p class="text">
    So he claims that he worked for the police on on call duty.
    <br>
    It can&rsquo;t be verified.
    <br>
    If someone would say that he used to work
    in a particular company,
    then this doesn&rsquo;t contradict his story.
    <br>
    Such a claim is typical for con artists.
    <br>
    Con artists will often claim
    that they are the police,
    a journalist and so on.

<p class="text">
    So it&rsquo;s the address of a company, a sound studio.
    <br>
    That matches his profession.
