    RE: Mr. James Walbert&rsquo;s Removal of Foreign Bodies
</p>

<p class="text">
    This letter is to be used
    in conjunction with the medical support reports
    that I have previously authored.
    My reports and findings were based on review
    of previous medical records/reports
    and advanced biological monitoring test results
    conducted through Integrative Health Systems, LLC.
</p>

<p class="text">
    It is of a severe medical necessity,
    that Mr. Walbert has these particular foreign bodies removed.
    The foreign bodies are composed
    of an implantable self-powered piezoelectric generator
    (generates 288 MHz)
    that is interfering with his normal muscle stimulations
    and severe overstimulation of site specific muscle contractions...
</p>

<p class="text">
    The over stimulation from piezoelectric micro/nano foreign bodies
    will cause Mr. Walbert&rsquo;s plasma membrane
    to form anchors for glycophorin "oxtyl glycosides"
    within the skeletal muscles and membrane vesicles on the surface
    where any previous bacterial, fungal, or viral residue
    may have lodged within his neurological system
    (Ex: ... exposure to containment SV 40 (Simian Virus 40-45)
    from polio vaccines as a child).
    As the anchoring effect occurs
    a magnification of the neuro electrical ouput
    from his bodies nervous system
    will be enhanced over 100%
    and cause internal electrical shock stimulations to his muscles.
</p>

<p class="text">
    These oxtyl glycosides are also associated
    with new clinical data from China...
    mu multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy.
    Therefore, if Mr. Walbert&rsquo;s muscles
    (through the overstimulation of the plezoelectric generators)
    cause the production of oxty glycosides,
    he will be at an increased risk to these diseases.
