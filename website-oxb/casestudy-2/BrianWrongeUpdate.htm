<h1>
    WRONGE REVISITED: UPDATE ON IMPLANT VICTIM&rsquo;S CASE
</h1>

<p class="text">
    As promised last week, we are updating our readers
    as to recent events surrounding implant victim BRIAN WRONGE. Many
    have inquired about the progress, if any, of Wronge&rsquo;s efforts to
    obtain a measure of justice for the heinous crime committed against
    him.
</p>

<p class="text">
    THE CITY SUN was the nation&rsquo;s first publication to
    bring Wronge&rsquo;s case to the public in our cover story by this writer,
    titled:
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;CHARGE OF HOLOCAUST: Medical Experiment on Black Inmate&rdquo;</i>
    (Dec. 15&ndash;21, 1993). Since that time, a few other publications out of
    state have covered the story. Also, Wronge has been interviewed by
    Marjorie Moore, Sean Ashton and Bernard White on WBAI radio, by the
    Rev. Del Shields and Donna Wilson on WWRL and also has guested on
    several radio programs outside of New York. In addition, Wronge has
    appeared on a Manhattan Cable television show.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Wronge was illegally implanted with paramagnetic
    computer chips in various parts of his body while a prisoner at
    Fishkill Correctional Facility. He believes the procedure was done
    when he entered a hospital for a diagnostic procedure. He emerged a
    human guinea pig.
</p>

<p class="text">
    In October 1987, he was taken to Bayley Seton
    Hospital in Staten Island for a bronchoscopy at the suggestion of
    prison doctors. Immediately upon awaking and for months afterward, he
    suspected that his body had somehow been tampered with by surgeons,
    including Dr. Vincent Tarantola, who now heads the hospital&rsquo;s
    pulmonary clinic.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Wronge&rsquo;s suspicions were verified when, after his
    release from prison, a CT scan and MRI performed at seperate
    diagnostic labs revealed the presence of
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;a paramagnetic foreign body artifact&rdquo;</i>
    under one arm and
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;dense rectangular&ndash;shaped metal foreign objects&rdquo;</i>
    in both inner ears. Subsequent examinations by physicians
    also corroborated these findings.
</p>

<p class="text">
    One physician told THE CITY SUN that an implant
    suspected to have been placed on Wronge&rsquo;s TRACHEA receives and
    transmits sound, including the high&ndash;pitched frequencies of his
    thoughts resonating on his voice box.
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;Remember that saying, &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t go to jail for what you think&rsquo;? Well, not anymore,&rdquo;</i>
    the doctor said.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Though this type of technology has been used for
    legitimate purposes for some time now, its used for prisoners without
    their consent is a blatant violation of the civil and physical rights
    of citizens. A surgeon who viewed Wronge&rsquo;s X&ndash;rays said,
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;A prosthetic device... is usually employed to replace a damaged element of the body. If he&rsquo;s never had a need for such a device, it should not be there, and certainly not without his knowledge.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    Wronge&rsquo;s efforts to secure a lawyer have thus far
    been unsuccessful. There&rsquo;s been some dodging and dangling by a few
    attorneys, but as yet no commitment of legal representation. He has,
    however, filed suit against the federal government and was instructed
    to have a surgeon remove one or more of the implants for examination
    by court&ndash;appointed experts. He has been unable to obtain this
    assistance to date, though he has had at least one adventure in the
    attempt.
