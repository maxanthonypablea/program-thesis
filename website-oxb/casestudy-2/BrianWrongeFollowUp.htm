<h1>
    IMPLANT VICTIM REFUSED HELP BY &lsquo;HUMANITARIAN&rsquo; PHYSICIANS
</h1>

<p class="text">
    The Boston chapter of PHYSICIANS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS (PHR) last
    month refused to examine or treat government implant victim Brian
    Wronge, against the protest of some of its members.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Wronge, a New York City resident, and former prisoner at
    Elmira and Arthur Kill correctional facilities from 1979 to 1989, was
    found positive for
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;paramagnetic metallic foreign bodies&rdquo;</i>
    in his head
    and chest in 1991 by both MRI and CT scan. The CT scan was performed
    by MRI&ndash;CT Scanning Inc. on May 6, 1991, and the MRI was performed
    three weeks later by Diagnostic Imaging Associates. Both labs are in
    New York City.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Further examination revealed miniature radios implanted in the
    membrane of Wronge&rsquo;s eardrums, according to a research biologist who
    examined Wronge with a OTOSCOPE. Use of such radio implants by
    CIA&ndash;funded experiments had been rumored since the 1960&rsquo;s, when
    individuals testified that institutes in UTAH had been using them on
    prisoners in that state without the victims&rsquo; knowledge.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Requests through the Freedom of Information Act to obtain
    documents on the UTAH experiments, to this date, have not been
    complied with.
</p>

<p class="text">
    A federal Eastern District Court Judge, Justice REENA RAGGI,
    has Wronge&rsquo;s lawsuit against the state of New York pending,
    instructing Wronge to find a surgeon to remove one of the implants.
    However, in the three years since the May 1991 lab reports, no
    surgeon would remove the implants, usually citing FBI RETALIATION as
    the reason.
</p>

<p class="text">
    In an effort to find Wronge a surgeon, his case was brought to
    the attention of PHR&rsquo;s BOSTON CHAPTER by one of its members three
    months ago. Although four prominent physicians supported the
    examination and pursuit of Wronge&rsquo;s covert surgery, the PHR board,
    according to director ERIC STOVER, decided in a meeting in mid&ndash;June
    to refuse assistance to Wronge. Wronge had offered to finance his own
    trip to minimize any budgetary reason the group might claim.
</p>

<p class="text">
    There have been repeated requests for the minutes of this June
    meeting, but the group claims the minutes are still not ready.
    Despite several attempted interviews throughout July, neither the
    staff members nor the director would reveal details of the meeting&rsquo;s
    dialogue, nor reveal which of the board members were present. One
    staff member did say,
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;Everyone saw the information &#91;the MRI and CT scan results&#93;. It was well-discussed among all the staff and all the board members.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    On July 21, a staff member stated,
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;No one here is allowed to speak with you. I was told to say that,&rdquo;</i>
    mentioning that the director
    gave the silence order prior to a vacation.
</p>

<p class="text">
    The tense atmosphere at PHR following the Wronge denial was
    also evident among board members who refused to discuss details of
    the behind&ndash;the&ndash;scenes dialogue, although two of them revealed through
    various conversations that they were subjected to INTENSE CAMPAIGNING
    BY COLLEAGUES NOT TO SUPPORT PURSUIT OF THE ISSUE. Dr. CAROLA
    EISENBERG, vice president of PHR, was eager to help Wronge in late
    April but, in May, was discouraged from doing so after a conversation
    with STOVER.
</p>

<p class="text">
    The PHR decision was highly controversial, considering the
    group&rsquo;s documented statement of purpose &mdash; the basis on which it is
    supported by their large MEMBERSHIP. The statement includes the
    following mandates:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        To stop torture that is committed by a government;
    </li>
    <li>
        To investigate violations of humanitarian law and medical
        ethics in internal conflicts; and
    </li>
    <li>
        To prevent physician complicity in human rights
        abuses
    </li>
</ol>

<p class="text">
    Furthermore, the denial of help to Wronge follows an early
    1994 opinion poll indicating that the group&rsquo;s membership wanted to
    use more of its resources to examine prisoners in the United States,
    strongly inferring that PHR was avoiding domestic issues.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Since PHR&rsquo;s inception in 1986, it repeatedly has rejected
    suggestions to address medical misconduct by government agencies.
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;We may have a case of a group that is not pursuing the very issues its membership is MAKING LARGE CONTRIBUTIONS to see rectified,&rdquo;</i>
    said one member of the Boston group.
</p>

<p class="text">
    THE CITY SUN spoke with ERIC STOVER about Hutcheon&rsquo;s charges.
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;This request went to the board, and the board felt that given the workload and the numbers of cases requiring our attention around the world, that we would not commit our limited resources to this case. We feel that what the plaintiff needs to do is to go to any properly certified general practitioner to obtain help. This does not indicate a lack of caring on our part. We have a small staff and limited funding, and we have to look at each case individually and make a decision.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p class="text">
    In response to Hutcheon&rsquo;s assertion that PHR does not address
    medical misconduct by U.S. government agencies, Stover said,
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s categorically and absolutely untrue.&rdquo;</i>
    He cited a Syracuse, N.Y.,
    prison case he says PHR investigated which resulted in a 60 Minutes
    story and the rectifying of the inhumane treatment. Stover said the
    organization has addressed numerous other domestic cases and also has
    worked on cases in Rwanda, Burundi, Mexico, Chile, Yugoslavia and
    other foreign countries.
</p>

<p class="text">
    Stover and the PHR secretary both disavowed knowledge of the
    opinion poll referred to by Hutcheon.
