    Re: Mr. James Walbert, Implant of Foreign Device
</p>

<p class="text">
    I have been acquainted with Mr. James Walbert
    for over three years
    and his personal struggle to get relief
    from the continuing electronic harassment,
    physical abuse and intimidation
    he is subjected to.
    I have complete confidence
    in the honesty and character of Mr. Walbert.
    He is an individual
    who is exhausting all avenues
    to get the RFID implanted device
    removed from his body.
</p>

<p class="text">
    There is sound medical evidence
    and medical evaluation
    to verify
    that an implanted device does exist
    in the body of Mr. Walbert....
    Technicians, medical clinicians and physicians,
    private detective agencies
    and other mental health professionals
    have verified the accuracy of reports and MRI scans
    about James Walbert....
    I implore those who have the experience and authority
    to remove this device or devices
    from the body of Mr. James Walbert
    as soon as possible.
    It is a humanitarian issue
    to let Mr. James Walbert return to a normal life.
