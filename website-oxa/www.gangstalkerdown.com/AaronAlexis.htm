            On June 3, 2004,
            the suspect shot out the tires
            of construction workers
            who were mocking him

            On September 4, 2010,
            he fired a gun inside his apartment
            because he had been angry
            about his downstairs neighbor
            making too much noise.

            On August 7, 2013,
            he was in Newport, Rhode Island.
            He was hearing voices.
            He changed hotels, but, he couldn&rsquo;t get away from the voices.
            He complained to the police.
            He said that he had changed hotels three times that night
            because three people were chasing him
            and keeping him awake by
            <i class="quote">&ldquo;sending vibrations into his body&rdquo;</i>
            by
            <i class="quote">&ldquo;using some sort of microwave machine&rdquo;</i>

            <br>
            <br>
            He had carved
            <i class="quote">&ldquo;My ELF weapon&rdquo;</i>
            into the stock of his weapon.

            Being taunted by construction workers
