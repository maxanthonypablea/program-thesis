</p>

<p>
    Two weeks before he slaughtered 12 people
    at the Washington Navy Yard,
    a desperate-sounding Aaron Alexis told
    an online &ldquo;mind control&rdquo; outreach group
    that the Navy was targeting his brain
    with extremely low frequency waves,
    according to a series of e-mails obtained exclusively by The Post.
</p>

<p>
    &ldquo;My name is Aaron.
    I am ex-navy,&rdquo; Alexis begins his correspondence with the group,
    Freedom from Covert Harassment &amp; Surveillance,
    in the first of three emails dated Sept. 1.
</p>

<p>
    &ldquo;I fear the constant bombardment from the ELF weapon
    is starting to take it&rsquo;s[sic] toll on my body,&rdquo; confided Alexis,
    an honorably discharged Navy reservist
    and a Department of Defense computer consultant.
</p>

<p>
    Just 15 days later,
    on Sept. 16,
    Alexis used his high-security clearance
    to enter the yard&rsquo;s Building #197,
    where he strafed a terrified crowd of Naval workers
    with his new Remington pump-action shot gun
    &mdash; with &ldquo;My ELF Weapon!&rdquo;
    hand-scratched into the firearm&rsquo;s stock &mdash;
    and a handgun he picked up off a fallen guard.
</p>

<p>
    He was eventually gunned down
    by authorities after a 30-minutes standoff.
</p>

<p>
    The Alexis e-mails,
    sent from aalexis654@gmail.com,
    offer the most in-depth window yet
    into the twisted murderer&rsquo;s panicked mind.
</p>

<p>
    They also suggest that
    the bloody rampage was plotted
    as a revenge attack against the US Navy
    &mdash; contrary to FBI statements
    that the former sailor did not appear
    to have had a specific target.
</p>

<p>
    &ldquo;I have what I believe to be
    the locations for where
    they&rsquo;ve been developing these weapons for decades,&rdquo;
    Alexis tells the group&rsquo;s president,
    Derrick Robinson,
    in one of the emails.
</p>

<p>
    &ldquo;The ELF weapons are part of the weapons systems
    of most of the modern vessels fielded by the Navy,&rdquo; Alexis wrote.
</p>

<p>
    The Navy has long acknowledged
    that it uses ultra low frequency signals
    in submarine communications;
    conspiracy theorists insist
    that the technology has also been &ldquo;weaponized&rdquo;
    by shadowy government and quasi-government groups.
</p>

<p>
    &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s alleging in his e-mails
    that the Navy has been conducting ELF research,
    and that they are using these technologies on citizens,
    and that he is one of the victims,&rdquo;
    Robinson,
    of Upland,
    CA,
    told The Post after sharing the e-mails.
</p>

<p>
    &ldquo;That is the reason he did this,
    apparently.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
    The first e-mail begins with an introduction,
    followed by a description
    of his earliest perceived ELF &ldquo;attack,&rdquo; from August.
    Police reports from that incident record
    Alexis telling the cops
    that while on Department of Defense assignment in Newport,
    RI,
    he had to change his hotel three times
    because he believed
    unseen people were talking to him
    via microwave signals.
</p>

<p>
    &ldquo;I have recently come under attack
    after blowing up at Norfolk airport in Virginia,&rdquo; he writes.
</p>

<p>
    &ldquo;The first attack started coming
    when I was on assignment in Rhode Island.
    I was hearing what I though
    was people next door telling lies about me.
    In truth I didn&rsquo;t know
    that I was under attack
    and thought I could escape
    what I was experiencing,
    by leaving the hotel I was in.
    It wasn&rsquo;t until
    it almost cost me my job
    that I realized that one,
    I wasn&rsquo;t crazy,
    and that two
    that I had to figure out
    what was going on.
</p>

<p>
    &ldquo;I am glad I found this site,
    however I need assistance because,
    I have not allowed them to scare me off my job,
    but I fear the constant bombardment
    from the ELF weapon
    is starting to take it&rsquo;s toll on my body.
    I am currently in DC now near the pentagon.
    I think I know the specific group in the military
    that is responsible for developing and assisting the military with.
</p>

<p>
    The first e-mail concludes,
</p>

<p>
    &ldquo;Any assistance you can give me
    and at the same time what ever info
    I can give you
    on what I know
    please contact me ASAP.
</p>

<p>
    &ldquo;Aaron Alexis&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
    Shortly after Robinson sent back a
    &ldquo;Thanks for writing to us&rdquo; response &mdash;
    telling Alexis
    &ldquo;Feel free to join our efforts
    to gain freedom from the matrix,&rdquo;
    Alexis wrote his own one-paragraph response:
</p>

<p>
    &ldquo;Derrick,
    I have what I believe to be
    the locations for where
    they&rsquo;ve been developing these weapons for decades.
    The ELF weapons are part of the weapons systems
    of most of the modern vessels fielded by the Navy.
    I want to become part of this effort
    mostly for self preservation.
    The voices they&rsquo;ve induced
    into my head are tiresome.
    However If I can figure out
    how to keep them from
    disturbing my sleep cycles
    I would be most interested
    to find out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
    Robinson responds again,
    offering to hook Alexis up with
    &ldquo;a good support network in the DC area,
    and asks Alexis
    if he has access to
    &ldquo;any of the technologies being used against us?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
    In his last reply,
    Alexis answers,
</p>

<p>
    &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have direct access to the equipment,
    how ever I do have knowledge of
    where some of the attacks might be coming from.
    I don&rsquo;t want to call you from my phone,
    they record everything I&rsquo;ve been saying.
    And because I&rsquo;m under the employ of the DoD
    I don&rsquo;t want to risk getting you or my self in trouble.
    If you can send me info on who to get in touch with,
    like addresses,
    I think would be better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
    When Robinson then asks
    if Alexis would like to communicate by instant message.
    Alexis never responded.
</p>

<p>
    Alexis&rsquo;s e-mails didn&rsquo;t raise any alarms,
    as they made no mention of violence or suicide,
    said Robinson and the group&rsquo;s vice president,
    Timothy White,
    of The Bronx.
</p>

<p>
    &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t that bad,&rdquo; White said.
    &ldquo;We have many,
    many people who call and they are on the verge of suicide.
    &rdquo;
</p>

<p>
    Added Robinson,
    &ldquo;I would have tried
    and we all would have tried our best
    to talk him out of any act of violence,
    if we had known about his intentions.
    &rdquo;
</p>

<p>
    The FBI,
    meanwhile,
    on Wednesday stood by its previous statements
    that Alexis&rsquo; rampage was a random act.
</p>

<p>
    &ldquo;The statements we&rsquo;ve already put out
    regarding motive and not believing
    he had any specific targets
    &mdash; we&rsquo;re not changing anything there,&rdquo; said Lindsey Godwin,
    a spokeswoman for the FBI&rsquo;s Washington field office.
