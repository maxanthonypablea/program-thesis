            Navy was told of Aaron Alexis
            &quot;hearing voices&quot;
            incident last month

        The Navy was told by authorities
        in Rhode Island last month
        of an incident in which
        Aaron Alexis complained
        that he was hearing voices,
        according to a police report
        on the incident.
        It is unclear
        whether the Navy followed up.

        Alexis was agitated
        when police paid him a visit
        at the Marriott Hotel
        he had checked into in Newport, R.I.
    </font>
</p>

<p>
    <font size=5>
        Local law enforcement had received a harassment complaint
        from someone in the hotel,
        and when they tracked down the source of the complaint
        --
        Alexis, the gunman in
        <font color="#003399">the Washington Navy Yard massacre</font>
        on Monday that killed 12 and wounded 8 more
        --
        the police wrote in their report of the incident
        that he complained about an
        &quot;unknown party&quot;
        of people he had never seen.
        Alexis said these people had been keeping him awake by
        &quot;sending vibrations into his body&quot;
        by
        &quot;using some sort of microwave machine.&quot;
    </font>
</p>

<p>
    <font size=5>
        While
        <font color="#003399">the motive in the Navy Yard massacre</font>
        is still unclear, a pattern of
        <font color="#003399">agitated and unsteady behavior</font>
        has emerged in the recent history
        of the suspected shooter.
        Officials say
        they're fairly certain
        the 34-year-old former Navy reservist
        had no connections to terrorism,
        but instead had a long history of mental health issues.

        Alexis told Newport police in August
        the unknown party following him around
        had been sending voices
        through the walls and ceiling.
        In their report,
        police said
        they tried to find out
        what the voices were saying,
        but Alexis wouldn't elaborate.
        Before parting,
        police claim Alexis said
        &quot;he does not have a history of mental illness
        in his family
        and that he has never had
        any sort of mental episode.&quot;
    </font>
</p>

<p>
    <font size=5>
        Police also said in the report
        that Alexis told them
        he had checked out
        of two other hotels
        to try to escape the voices
        before checking into the Marriott.

        Newport Police Sgt. Frank Rosa says
        in the report
        that he informed the Navy
        of the Marriott incident.
        &quot;Based on the Naval base implications,&quot;
        Rosa wrote,
        &quot;and the claim
        that the involved subject ...
        was 'hearing voices,'
        I made contact with on duty Naval Station Police.
        I advised of the report
        and the claims.&quot;
        Rose added that
        Navy authorities said
        they would follow up
        to determine if Alexis was indeed
        a Navy base contractor.

        A look at Alexis' prior arrest record indicates
        that he has a history of mental health issues.

        On June 3, 2004,
        Alexis was arrested in Seattle
        for shooting out
        the tires of another man's car
        on May 6
        in what Alexis told police
        was an anger-fueled
        &quot;blackout.&quot;
        It appeared Alexis may have been angry
        with construction workers
        who were using parking spaces
        in his neighborhood.
    </font>
</p>

<p>
    <font size=5>
        On Sept. 4, 2010,
        Alexis was arrested
        for allegedly firing a gun
        inside his Texas apartment
        because he had been angry
        about his downstairs neighbor
        making too much noise.
        At the time
        he was a Navy reservist
        stationed in Fort Worth.
    </font>
</p>

<p>
    <font size=5>
        Officials say Alexis also had
        <font color="#003399">
            bouts of insubordination,
            disorderly conduct
            and being absent from work
            without authorization
        </font>
        during his four years
        as a full-time reservist.
        He frequently complained about discrimination,
        and officials say
        his behavior led to
        an early but honorable discharge in 2011.
    </font>
</p>

<p>
    <font size=5>
        When he left the Navy reserves,
        he managed to keep his security clearance
        upon becoming a military contractor
        because his incidents with police
        never rose to the level
        of raising an alarm
        about him being mentally unfit.
        Additionally,
        his arrests never gave cause
        to bar him from buying a firearm,
        including the shotgun officials say
        he bought recently in Virginia
        to carry out the Navy Yard massacre.
    </font>
</p>

<p>
    <font size=5>
        At the time of the rampage,
        Alexis was an employee with a Defense Department subcontractor
        on a Navy-Marine Corps computer project,
        authorities told the Associated Press.
        Alexis had access to the Navy Yard
        via a valid pass.
    </font>
</p>

<p>
    <font size=5>
        The roots of Alexis' issues are still being examined,
        but after his 2004 arrest in Seattle,
        both Alexis' father and Alexis himself told police
        he had been present during
        &quot;the tragic events of September 11, 2001&quot;
        and that they had disturbed him.
        His father told police
        he suffered from PTSD
        and that his mental issues stretch back at least a decade.
    </font>
</p>

<p>
    <font size=5>
        After the Newport, R.I.,
        run-in with police August,
        Alexis
        <font color="#003399">sought treatment for mental health issues</font>
        from the Department of Veterans Affairs,
        officials say.
    </font>
</p>

<p>
    <font size=5>
        Until recently,
        Alexis lived in Fort Worth
        at the home of Melinda Downs,
        reports CBS News correspondent Bob Orr.
        She said Alexis suffered from PTSD and insomnia.
        She told reporters he loved the military
        and showed no signs of violence.
    </font>
</p>

<p>
    <font size=5>
        &quot;It's like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, who was this guy?&quot;
        Downs said.
        &quot;The guy that I knew was so honorable. It breaks my heart.&quot;
