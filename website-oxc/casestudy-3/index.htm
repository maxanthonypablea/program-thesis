<p>
    Gang stalking is stalking by several people
    who know each other
    and who have the same intent.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="zn">Mobbing</span>
    is the most familiar type of gang stalking.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="zn">Bullying</span>
    is also a familiar type of gang stalking
    when several children participate.
</p>

<p>
    1 in 70 people experience gang stalking.
    1 in 30 workers experience mobbing at work.
    7 in 10 middle school and high school students
    experience bullying in school.    
</p>

<p>
    Gang stalking occurs frequently in
    <span class="zn">apartment buildings</span>,
    <span class="zn">housing estates</span>,
    <span class="zn">shops</span>,
    and
    <span class="zn">libraries</span>.
</p>

<p>
    Gang stalking is also perpetrated by
    <span class="zn">agents of the state</span>,
    the
    <span class="zn">Mafia</span>,
    <span class="zn">religious sects</span>,
    and
    <span class="zn">utility companies</span>
    (electricity, gas, water, telephone, cable TV, internet).
</p>

<p>
    Gang stalking can be so bad
    that you can never escape some degree of harassment.
    The harassment is often carried out
    in a way to blame the victim
    for the harassment.
    This is called
    <span class="zn">victim blaming</span>.
</p>

<p>
    Gang stalking by
    <span class="zn">agents of the state</span>
    is an extreme form of fascism.
    In particular,
    a few victims have proven that they have implants.
    This is the most invasive type of stalking.
    It&rsquo;s the most totalitarian invention in history.
</p>

<p>
    Every article about gang stalking on Wikipedia
    has been deleted.
    Wikipedia has a problem with telling the truth
    when it&rsquo;s embarrassing,
    like telling
    how many pets are abandoned each year
    (about 1 cat and 1 dog per 300 citizens),
    not to mention the number of people
    who fell under communism,
    50 million perhaps?
    We urge you to suspend your belief in Wikipedia.
    Wikipedia finds pleasure in labeling the victims as mentally ill.
    We know that
    gang stalking and electronic harassment are designed
    to be used against everyone.
    At least one Al Qaeda suspect
    reported gross human rights violations
    in a detention centre in Guantanamo
    including electronic harassment.
</p>

<p>
    After a consultation with James Walbert,
    Clinical Psychologist Cathy Meadows, M.A. wrote:
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;The techniques used against these targeted individuals are purposely designed to make the victim appear to have a mentally disorder in order to invalidate any claims of wrongdoing by the perpetrators. It is a highly organized and multi&ndash;faceted attack that is used by many political and religious extremists, by corporations and businesses, and even by organized crime.&rdquo;</i>

    Dr. Seth Farber wrote:
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;Directed energy weapons are among the high-tech arms of the century. They hurt and kill with electromagnetic power. Microwave weapons can be aimed at computers, electrical devices, and persons. They have strong physical and psychological effects and can be used for military and terrorist activities. These weapons are also part of crimes (in Europe) that almost nobody knows except the victims and the offenders. Until now they make the perfect crime possible. No doubt, these weapons have a terrible future.&rdquo;</i>

<p>
    If you are a victim,
    then I recommend that you download the
    <a href="http://www.GangstalkerDown.com/Media/Downloads/Backup.zip">backup of my gang stalking websites on May 12, 2014</a>
    <i class="zip">(ZIP, 209.2&nbsp;MB)</i>.
    Save this to a USB stick
    and keep it always in your wallet.
    This will help you
    whenever you have to defend yourself
    against accusations of mental illness.

<p>
    Our definition allows to see different types of gang stalking:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        mobbing,
    </li>
    <li>
        bullying,
    </li>
    <li>
        stalking in apartment buildings,
    </li>
    <li>
        neighborhood stalking,
    </li>
    <li>
        judges and lawyers who are stalked by the Mafia
        because they sent a Mafia member to jail,
    </li>
    <li>
        stalking by the state.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Victims who complain
    on the internet
    are usually victims of gang stalking by the state.
    This is a life long experience.
</p>

<p>
    It&rsquo;s very difficult to get the word out about this
    because:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        The government denies that this is happening.
    </li>
    <li>
        The police are instructed not to help victims.
    </li>
    <li>
        Doctors are instructed to declare victims crazy.
    </li>
    <li>
        The press refuses to write about it
        because they get their tips from the police.
    </li>
    <li>
        The attacks are carried out in a deniable way.
    </li>
    <li>
        There are not many aware victims.
    </li>
    <li>
        The victims are unorganized.
    </li>
    <li>
        The victims have often problems
        with employment, housing, justice and so on,
        problems caused by perps.
    </li>
    <li>
        The victims can&rsquo;t say
        who would want to do this and why.
    </li>
    <li>
        The victims are often incapacitated
        by electronic weapons.
    </li>
    <li>
        Perps pose as victims
        and spread ludicrous stories.
        They give victims
        a bad reputation.
    </li>
    <li>
        No one has ever admitted
        that he was a gang stalker.
        It can be compared to the time
        when no one had ever admitted
        that he was a Mafia member.
        Specifically we would like to know:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Do gang stalkers carry concealed guns?
            </li>
            <li>
                Do gang stalkers have combat training or martial arts training?
            </li>
            <li>
                Do gang stalkers have preparedness training?
            </li>
            <li>
                Do gang stalkers have meetings
                where they sing sinister songs?
            </li>
            <li>
                Do gang stalkers have to give
                a part of their income
                to the stalking organization?
            </li>
            <li>
                Do gang stalkers have to sign blank papers?
            </li>
            <li>
                Do gang stalkers have to agree
                with an arranged marriage or adoption?
            </li>
            <li>
                Do gang stalkers have to
                &lsquo;volunteer&rsquo; for medical experiments? 
            </li>
            <li>
                Do gang stalkers have to donate organs
                to the stalking organization?
            </li>

    <span class="zn">Gang stalking</span>
    is mentioned in several scientific articles,
    which were published in scientific journals.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="zn">Gang stalking</span>
    was discussed
    during a congress for criminologists in Barcelona

    The Belgian diplomat
    <span class="zn">Myrianne Coen</span>
    (pronounce Koon)
    used to work in the Belgian embassy in Bulgaria.
    In 1995 she noticed that
    the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs
    delivered visas to people
    of which she knew
    that they were personalities
    of the Bulgarian Mafia.
    She warned the Ministry several times.
    But, they ignored her.
    Even worse,
    they started to
    <span class="zn">gang stalk</span>
    her.
    Finally, in December 1996,
    she filed an official complaint
    for documents trafficking.
    In this complaint,
    she describes the gang stalking.
    Three months later
    she was found unconscious
    in the embassy.
    The Ministry sent her to a mental hospital.
    The diagnosis corroborated the testimony of persons
    who were involved in the harassment.
    She got fired.
    Her career spiralled down.
    They tried to cover it up
    for several years.
    In 2004 the Standing Intelligence Agencies Review Committee
    confirmed her claims.
    The Bulgarian Mafia had paid for the visas.
    She got a new job as an expert
    in the Military Centre for Strategic Studies
    in Rome.
</p>

<p>
    This affair got much coverage in the news.

<p>
    In 2006 the Belgian criminologist
    <span class="zn">Jean-Nicolas Desurmont</span>
    interviewed the secret services of Belgium and France,
    and 13 victims: a professor, a judge, a lawyer, a diplomat and so on.
    Then he published his first article.

    There are three types of stalking:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <span class="zn">single stalking</span>,
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="zn">multiple stalking</span>,
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="zn">organizational stalking</span>.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    If someone has a divorce
    because he wants a gay lifestyle,
    and his ex stalks him,
    and his neighbor stalks him
    because he doesn&rsquo;t want a gay neighbor,
    then this is for the victim
    an experience which is different
    from the other types,
    so we see three types.
</p>

<p>
    Stalking is organizational if:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        there are at least 2 stalkers,
    </li>
    <li>
        they know each other,
    </li>
    <li>
        they have the same intent.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Organizational stalking is called
    <span class="zn">gang stalking</span>.
</p>

<p>
    The essence of intimidation in group is:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        the tyrannical attitude
        (denial of the point of view of the defense of the victim),
    </li>
    <li>
        the attitude of denunciation
        (circulation of rumors concerning the victim).
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    There are two types of gang stalking:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <span class="zn">political gang stalking</span>
        perpetrated by
        <span class="zn">political networks</span>
        (government agents),
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="zn">apolitical gang stalking</span>
        perpetrated by
        <span class="zn">apolitical networks</span>
        (Mafia).
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Apolitical gang stalking
    is organized by the Mafia.
    Their goal is revenge.
    (The Mafia can&rsquo;t stand
    some specific judges and lawyers.)
</p>

<p>
    Political gang stalking
    is organized by the
    <span class="zn">military intelligence</span>.
    The goal is to fight organized crime.
    Specifically:
    to fight apolitical gang stalking
    perpetrated by apolitical networks
    from other countries.
    This is
    <span class="zn">counterintelligence</span>
    so this is done by the army.
    Political gang stalking is the usual way
    in which large drugs trafficking rings
    are dismantled.
</p>

<p>
    The procedure:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        They choose almost randomly a person.
    </li>
    <li>
        They isolate him
        from the people that he knew
        by making him appear crazy.
    </li>
    <li>
        He gathers new suspect people around him.
    </li>
    <li>
        All these people are put under investigation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Wherever the suspect people go,
        the army recruits snitches.
        They form a large network
        that collects information.
        This can be stimulated
        with quota and bonuses
        for writing reports.
    </li>
    <li>
        Where it goes from here depends on
        the circumstances:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Normally it goes on forever.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the suspect people
                cause a financial loss for the government,
                especially when there&rsquo;s much drug related crime,
                then they are quickly arrested.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the suspect people
                appear to be
                an apolitical network
                then they are dismantled
                by monitoring and analyzing
                their cell phone use:
                the army knows where they are
                when they call each other.
                In this way
                they dismantled a gang stalking network
                in Louvain-la-Neuve
                (which counts 10,000 citizens)
                in Belgium.
                That&rsquo;s to the southeast of Brussels.
                The members were all over the city.
                There was 50 metre between them.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the victim becomes aware
                of the harassment
                then he will resist.
                Generally,
                this is the situation
                of people who out themselves
                as a
                <span class="zn">targeted individual</span>.
                Then the goal changes:
                the victim has to be removed
                as quickly as possible
                from society
                so he can&rsquo;t spread what he knows:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        prison,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        bedlam,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        forced suicide,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        murder.
                        In this case,
                        they will first toy some time
                        with the victim
                        to make him fear for his life.
                        Then they suddenly kill him.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    The surveillance of a targeted individual implies
    that he&rsquo;s surveilled
    by several dozens of members of the police
    and military secret service per day.
</p>

<p>
    The interference in his private life
    is more effective
    when it&rsquo;s insidious,
    thus facilitating the general approval
    of the thesis of mental illness.
</p>

<p>
    A gang stalking campaign is successful
    if the victim can&rsquo;t prove the harassment.
</p>

<p>
    The political success of these actions
    lies in the number of investigations
    carried out against offenders and criminals
    who have been at a certain moment
    in the immediate circle
    of the victim of harassment
    while avoiding
    that the victim understands the fact
    that he&rsquo;s the pawn
    that serves as a starting point
    in the identification of suspect persons.
    These persons will proactively be investigated
    later.
</p>

<p>
    The circle of a targeted individual
    or an important individual
    is always placed under surveillance.
</p>

<p>
    Lookalikes of the circle of the victim are used
    by the forces of law and order
    to detect the persons
    who are informed of the characteristics
    of the circle of the victim.
</p>

<p>
    So the victim is a disposable object
    around which the network is built.
    Who the victim is and what he has done
    doesn&rsquo;t matter at any point in the procedure.
    The network is the political goal.
</p>

<p>
    The
    <span class="zn">characteristic property</span>
    of political gang stalking is
    that they make the victim appear crazy.
</p>

<p>
    All these categories are gang stalkers:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        nurses,
    </li>
    <li>
        ambulances,
    </li>
    <li>
        firemen,
    </li>
    <li>
        private and public security companies,
    </li>
    <li>
        banks,
    </li>
    <li>
        managers of institutions,
    </li>
    <li>
        embassies,
    </li>
    <li>
        harbour master&rsquo;s offices,
    </li>
    <li>
        psychiatry,
    </li>
    <li>
        some private institutions like universities.
        Gang stalking has been observed
        for 12 months
        in a French speaking university in Belgium.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Gang stalkers collect information from the private life
    of their victim.
    Then this information is fed
    through the media
    to the victim.
    Victims call this
    <span class="zn">media feedback</span>.
    The right name is
    <span class="zn">macro counter-espionage</span>.
    In Belgium the Communications Service
    of the Ministry of Home Affairs
    delivers the
    <span class="zn">ingredients</span>
    to the media.
    This can be, for example,
    a first name.
    Then the media have to build
    the news item around this word.
    For example,
    when a child is missing,
    then the news item might be read by a journalist
    with the name Vandeputte,
    which is Dutch for Dutroux.
    For example,
    when a person with Down&rsquo;s syndrome is in the news
    then the news anchor won&rsquo;t say his name,
    except if he has the same family name as the victim.
    The media are sponsored by political persons.
    The media get their information from police and intelligence services.
    So they have no choice.
    They have to cooperate.
    The goal is to stop criminal actions
    of apolitical networks
    by showing
    that the government can do the same espionage
    as the apolitical networks.

    Some subjects are missing in his articles:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Freemasonry,
    </li>
    <li>
        mind control,
    </li>
    <li>
        electronic harassment,
    </li>
    <li>
        voice to skull,
    </li>
    <li>
        implants,
    </li>
    <li>
        satanism.
        (There are strong hints
        that the gang stalkers are a
        <span class="zn">satanist</span>
        cult.
        Currently we can&rsquo;t prove that.
        But, clearly, there&rsquo;s more
        that we don&rsquo;t know yet.)
    </li>
    <li>
        He treats it as a national problem.
        For example,
        he explains why Belgian victims hear details
        from their private life
        in the Belgian news on TV,
        but he doesn&rsquo;t explain why
        they experience the same
        with TV channels
        of many other countries.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    We know more categories of gang stalkers:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        medical doctors,
    </li>
    <li>
        dentists,
    </li>
    <li>
        bus drivers,
    </li>
    <li>
        train drivers,
    </li>
    <li>
        taxi drivers,
    </li>
    <li>
        personnel of utility companies (gas, electricity, telephone, cable TV and so on),
    </li>
    <li>
        private and public gardening services,
    </li>
    <li>
        teachers.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Gang stalking is performed
    as much as possible
    at the expense of their employers and the government.
    So we see many stalkers
    who have to travel for their job.
</p>

<p>
    Some questions remain unanswered:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Why do targets experience the same harassments
        in every country they go,
        even in a country
        that is an enemy
        of their country of origin?
    </li>
    <li>
        Why are nearly all victims single women and gay men?
    </li>
    <li>
        Why are most victims female?
        If this is about fighting crime,
        then 90% of the victims should be male,
        because 90% of all crime
        is done by men.
    </li>
    <li>
        Why do all the police in the world
        deny that gang stalking exists?
    </li>
    <li>
        Why are networks like
        <span class="zn">Al Qaeda</span>
        or
        <span class="zn">Hezbollah</span>
        never attacked with gang stalking?
    </li>
    <li>
        Why did no one ever admit
        that he was a gang stalker?
        People have admitted
        that they were a spy, informant,
        Freemason, Mafia member, hitman or terrorist.
        Outing oneself as a gang stalker
        seems to be a problem of a higher order.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Most victims are not in a position
    to teach you something about organized crime.
</p>

<p>
    In the past,
    the victims of the state
    were usually deaf, blind, handicapped,
    in the mental hospital or a home for the elderly.
</p>

<p>
    So it looks more as if this is not about fighting crime,
    but about getting rid of people who can be missed,
    as they did in Nazi Germany.
</p>

<p>
    So now we open our mind
    for the mind control atrocities of the past
    and see whether we find the answer there.
</p>



<h2><a class="h2" name="Mind control">Mind control</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="Media/Images/Style/Edit.gif" width="29" height="13" alt="[edit]" border="0"></h2>

<p>
    <span class="zn">Mind control</span>
    is the systematic use
    of unethically manipulative methods
    to persuade others to conform
    to the wishes of the manipulator.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="zn">Gang stalking</span>
    is a sort of mind control.
    Gang stalking is a hate crime.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="zn">Electronic harassment</span>
    is another sort of mind control.
    Electronic harassment is the use of electronic devices
    to harass, torture, and/or physically harm a person,
    or even the pets of the victim.
    Many electronic devices can have a negative side effect on your health.
    So they can be used for harassment.
</p>

<p>
    About 50% of gang stalking victims experience
    also electronic harassment.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="zn">Voice to skull</span>
    is a sort of electronic harassment.
    Many gang stalking victims hear voices.
    We suppose that the perpetrators use voice to skull
    to harass and hypnotize their victims.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="zn">Implants</span>
    are a sort of electronic harassment.
    It&rsquo;s the most invasive type of stalking.
    Some implant victims don&rsquo;t experience gang stalking.
    Gang stalking victims see them as
    <span class="zn">medical experimentees</span>.
</p>

<p class="prentje" align="center">
    <img src="Media/Images/Home/MindControl.png" width="508" height="377" alt="Mind control Venn diagram" border="0">
</p>

<p>
    Mind control victims are very much like prisoners of war
    who have been tortured.
    The difference is
    that they don&rsquo;t know
    why they have been tortured,
    they don&rsquo;t have their own army or support system,
    they have been tortured by citizens of their own country,
    and the torture is generally ongoing.
    Rather than any sort of sympathy or respect
    for having
    <i class="quote">served their country</i>
    by being selected for exploitation and torture
    for the sake of what is called
    <i class="quote">national security</i>
    or
    <i class="quote">freedom</i>,
    these veterans of mind control abuse
    are subjected to ridicule and abuse.
    The psychological torture,
    and often the physical torture,
    is ongoing.

<h2><a class="h2" name="Origin">Origin</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="Media/Images/Style/Edit.gif" width="29" height="13" alt="[edit]" border="0"></h2>

<p>
    The origin of gang stalking is the
    <span class="zn">Vehmic tribunal</span>
    in Germany.
    It&rsquo;s called
    <span class="zn">Vehmgericht</span>
    in German.
    It looked very much like Freemasonry.
    It was introduced by
    <span class="zn">Charlemagne</span>
    to get the areas
    that he conquered on the Germans
    under control.
</p>

<p>
    This goal is different from what Desurmont has described.
</p>

<p>
    Later the
    <span class="zn">Stasi</span>
    developed the current methods of gang stalking.
    They were copied by many other countries.
</p>

<p>
    The goal of the Stasi was
    to make people stop damaging communism.
</p>

<p>
    So gang stalking isn&rsquo;t new.
    It exists already 800 years in its current form.
    But, this is new:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>It&rsquo;s a world wide network.</li>
    <li>They use instant electronic communication.</li>
    <li>They use electronic weapons.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Today, the 21st degree of the
    <span class="zn">Scottish Rite</span>
    of Freemasonry
    is a representation of the Vehmic tribunal.

<p>
    The
    <span class="zn">National Centre for Victims of Crime</span>
    of the USA
    <span class="zn">Department of Justice</span>
    has a website:
    <a href="http://www.VictimsOfCrime.org" target="blank">www.VictimsOfCrime.org</a>

    about stalking victims of 18 years old or older.

<p>
    They don&rsquo;t publish numbers
    about victims of multiple stalkers.
</p>

<p>
    But, the statistics show
    that about 5% of stalking victims
    is a victim of at least one man
    <span class="zn">plus</span>
    one woman.
    This allows the following interesting calculation.
</p>

<p class="prentje" align="center">
    <img src="Media/Images/Home/NCVCStalkingVictims.gif" width="501" height="141" alt="Spreadsheet that shows the number of victims of multiple stalkers" border="0">
</p>

<p>
    The statistics show
    that about one in 1,000 persons
    is an 18 years old or older
    victim of stalking
    by at least one man
    <span class="zn">plus</span>
    one woman:
    <span class="zn">multiple stalkers</span>.
</p>

<p>
    We may assume that
    the number of people who are stalked by two men
    and
    the number of people who are stalked by two women
    is equal to
    the number of people who are stalked by one man
    <span class="zn">plus</span>
    one woman.
</p>

<p>
    It shows
    that about 3 in 1,000 persons
    are 18 years old or older
    victims of stalking
    by at least 2 persons.
</p>

<p>
    So if you live in a city with 10,000 citizens
    then there should be 30 persons
    of 18 years old or older
    who experience this.
    That&rsquo;s about one person in every 4 streets.
</p>

<p>
    It shows
    that stalking by multiple stalkers isn&rsquo;t rare.

    <span class="zn">gang stalking</span>,

    several ordinary words describe something controversial.
    One of the results is that
    when people want to describe gang stalking,
    then they will write complex sentences
    that are too difficult for children.
    These expressions make it more difficult

    The victims call themselves
    <span class="zn">targeted individuals</span>.
</p>

<p>
    In June 2013,
    there were about 1,400 persons
    who have outed themselves as a victim.

<p>
    60% of all victims are women.
    Most of them are independent women,
    who live alone
    and who want to make a career.
</p>

<p>
    40% of all victims are men.
    98% of them are gay.
</p>

<p>
    Proud men with a high self-esteem
    attract this harassment.

    is totally different from
    the distribution of
    <span class="zn">schizophrenia</span>.
    These charts prove that the victims are not mentally ill.
</p>

<p>
    Most victims have in common:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        They are perceived as not heterosexual enough.
        (They are not married, or they don&rsquo;t have children.)
    </li>
    <li>
        Their family has connections with the army or security services.

<p>
    Victims of gang stalking by the state
    have to wonder their whole life
    who is doing this to them and why.
</p>

<p>
    I find this obvious questions.
    If you are a victim,
    then you certainly deserve to know the answer.
</p>

<h3><a class="h2" name="Who">Who</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="Media/Images/Style/Edit.gif" width="29" height="13" alt="[edit]" border="0"></h3>

<p>
    There are two theories:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        In the USA they believe that
        the secret services organize gang stalking
        and that these secret services are populated by Freemasons.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the UK they believe that
        the Freemasons organize gang stalking
        and that these Freemasons use the secret services
        to push their agenda.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    I follow the British theory.
    As far as I know,
    Freemasonry is the only organization
    that is so corrupt and so mentally insane
    that it could be responsible
    for organizing gang stalking.
</p>

<p>
    Clearly, there are relatively more victims
    in countries where
    there are relatively more
    <span class="zn">Freemasons</span>.
</p>

<p>
    This doesn&rsquo;t mean that all gang stalkers are Freemasons.
    The number of gang stalkers
    is much higher
    than the number of regular and accepted Freemasons.
    (The whisperers say 96% of the population.)
    The gang stalkers are a secret society,
    and they are satanists,
    but they are no regular and accepted Freemasons.
    Many gang stalkers are too young,
    too poor,
    or too abnormal to apply for membership.
</p>

<p>
    Gang stalkers who are not a Freemason are called
    <span class="zn">familiars</span>.
    They are people who help Freemasons
    because they hope
    that some day
    they will get an invitation
    to become Freemason.
</p>

<p>
    I know that it sounds far-fetched:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Freemasons organize gang stalking.
    </li>
    <li>
        Freemasons are satanists.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    I&rsquo;m aware that Freemasons won&rsquo;t like it
    when I write like that.
    I also read complaints on other websites.
</p>

<p>
    Now look at the evidence:
</p>

<p>
    If you want to learn to know the Freemasons,
    then listen to the people who left Freemasonry.
    Jim Shaw was a Freemason from Florida,
    who left Freemasonry,
    and who converted to Christianity.
    He claimed to be a 33rd degree Freemason,
    but I ignore whether that was true.
    He wrote the book
    <span class="zn">Deadly Deception</span>.
    This is a quote from Jim Shaw
    that is circulating on the internet:
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;All have mental questions
    to even join in the first place.
    To be so corrupt&hellip;
    so criminally insane,
    mentally insane&hellip;
    to gangstalk the helpless&hellip;
    to murder the helpless&hellip;
    to teach their children
    to hate the "profane,"
    you and I,
    the non masons&hellip;
    to worship not 1 but 3 evil gods&hellip;
    to join something and swear to,
    not having NO idea what you have sworn to&hellip;
    pure insanity !!!&hellip;
    to enjoy little boys and girls&hellip;
    even their own children&hellip;
    and their mothers&hellip;
    themselves in the rituals.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p>
    This quote says clearly:
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;to gangstalk the helpless&hellip;&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p>
    In July 1889,
    Albert Pike was the Sovereign Pontiff
    of the Universal Freemasonry.
    He wrote in a letter:
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;The true and pure philosophic religion is the belief in Lucifer, the equal of God.&rdquo;</i>
</p>


<h3><a class="h2" name="Why">Why</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="Media/Images/Style/Edit.gif" width="29" height="13" alt="[edit]" border="0"></h3>

<p>
    Clearly, Freemasons organize gang stalking
    because they are doing their master,
    the Satan,
    a favor.
</p>

<p>
    But, there&rsquo;s more.
    Now take a look at this.
    These are the things
    that Freemasons hate most of all:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        celibacy,
    </li>
    <li>
        homosexuality.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    It&rsquo;s very easy to connect the dots:
    gang stalking is organized by Freemasons
    because they believe that you HAVE to reproduce.
</p>

<p>
    Now take a look at their symbol, the square and compass:
</p>

<p class="prentje">
    <img src="Media/Images/Home/PhallusInUterusGod.jpg" width="175" height="206" alt="Phallus in uterus God" border="0">
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        The square represents the vagina or the earth.
    </li>
    <li>
        The compass represents the phallus or the sun
        which impregnates the earth
        with life-producing rays.
    </li>
    <li>
        The G means Generation: creation of new life.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    So the symbol means
    <span class="zn">phallus in uterus God</span>.
    It means that hetero sex is God.
</p>

<p>
    Of course,
    a secret organization
    that pledges oaths of persecution
    and that is obsessed with reproduction
    has to be really bad news for single women and gay men,
    the usual victims of gang stalking.
    This becomes visual in gang stalking.
    This is how they revealed themselves.
</p>

<p>
    The word
    <span class="zn">Freemasonry</span>
    is now silently being replaced with the word
    <span class="zn">gang stalking</span>
    because that&rsquo;s the activity for which we know them best.

        You hear
        <span class="zn">directed conversations</span>.
        These are conversations that are directed
        at you but in a deniable way.
        For example:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Someone walks his dog.
                When he passes you he says
                <i class="quote">&ldquo;Stupid fool&rdquo;</i>
                to his dog.
            </li>
            <li>
                You eat much because it&rsquo;s cold.
                When you leave there&rsquo;s a man
                who says
                <i class="quote">&ldquo;You eat too much&rdquo;</i>
                to his little child.

        You are often being gassed:
        <ul>
            <li>
                you&rsquo;re being sprayed with pesticide in the library,
            </li>
            <li>
                fumes from scooters, trucks, tractors, busses, boats,

            <li>
                the neighbors have a leaking oil reservoir,
            </li>
            <li>
                the chimneys of the neighbors are too low.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        You experience many times more than usual:

            <li>
                wrong number calls,
            </li>
            <li>
                street lights go out or go on
                when you walk or drive under them,
            </li>
            <li>
                break-ins without leaving trace,
            </li>
            <li>

            <li>
                things disappear

                your path is blocked
                when you walk or drive.

                    <li>
                        someone slips ahead of you

    If you recognize several events

<ul>

        Fake sounds:
        <ul>
            <li>
                ear ringing:
                a loud steady tone,
                like a dialling tone.
                This is generally in the left ear.
                (Left means no, right means yes.)
            </li>
            <li>

                clock ringing,

            <li>
                loud bird calls that follow you everywhere.

    <li>
        Unusual headache.
        For example,
        every Friday at 11 AM
        you get suddenly a debilitating headache
        that is suddenly over on Saturday at 11 AM.
        This continues for dozens of years.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fake vision:

            <li>
                You see vivid 3D images while being awake,

            <li>
                People seem to appear from nowhere
                and are suddenly on the road.
                (The person was temporarily removed from your vision.
                What your eyes see is mixed with an image of the empty road,
                and the result is sent to your brain.)

                        false awakening.

                        You see red and blue blurs

                    <li>

                        The dreams are inside buildings without windows.

                Your erotic fantasy

                with things that are not erotic,
                and that you don&rsquo;t want.
                For example, if you think of your lover
                then he/she is replaced with a photograph
                of the house of your parents
                that you didn&rsquo;t see in 20 years,
                so it becomes impossible to think of your lover.

        Observation in your house:

            <li>
                People repeat something in public
                that was said privately in your home.
            </li>
            <li>
                Neighbors make sounds
                that are synchronized
                with what you&rsquo;re doing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Neighbors leave
                at the same moment
                that you leave.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you leave
                and you come back
                then you see that they have tampered
                with what you were doing.
            </li>
        </ul>
        This is probably done with pinhole cameras
        and microphones.
        I don&rsquo;t believe
        that they would use through-wall radar
        when a pinhole camera is much cheaper
        and gives a much better image.

        Memory problems:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Blocked memories.
                You forget things.
                For example, you turn a page
                in a magazine,
                you see a photograph
                of your idol
                but you can&rsquo;t remember his name.
            </li>
            <li>
                Inserted memories.
                For example, you remember
                that you read something
                in a letter.
                But, there was no such letter.
                (It was a dream.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Erased memories.
                You have a good idea,
                but suddenly you loose the idea
                and how hard you try,
                it doesn&rsquo;t come back.

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Repeated instances where it seems
        that your mind is being read.
        For example, someone repeats
        what you were thinking.
        This can be done with subvocal recognition
        or remote neural monitoring.
    </li>
    <li>
        Repeated instances where it seems
        that your mind is being changed.
        For example,
        you were thinking of a lion
        while sitting on the train.
        When you leave the railway station,
        there&rsquo;s a billboard with a lion.

    This is one of the most useful things
    that you can do as a victim.
    Perps assume that no one will ever hear
    what happened to you,
    because gang stalking sites and victim blogs
    are only visited by a handful of victims,
    so the perps can do whatever they want.
    This changes when John Finch
    sends your story to a long list
    of email addresses.
</p>

<p>
    Start your message like this:
</p>

    Later you can update your story.
    Your new message will be appended to your old story.
    So you write only what&rsquo;s new.

    These testimonies show that
    <span class="zn">gang stalking victims</span>
    are experiencing the same specific harassments
    all over the world
    while
    the experiences of
    <span class="zn">schizophrenics</span>
    are more general and more different.
    These testimonies prove that the victims are not mentally ill.

    There&rsquo;s a countermeasure that works:
    an underground facility
    with vacuum panels against the walls, the ceilings and the floors.

        This book looks a bit like a comic strip album.
        It tells the story of the movie
        and gives you some background information.
        A few years ago,
        they started to distribute
        a comic strip album
        that makes people believe
        that they have schizophrenia
        if they believe this sort of things.
        So there should also be a comic strip album
        that tells people that they are normal
        if they believe this sort of things.
        This science fiction movie
        contains much material
        of which we suppose that it exists,
        of which we can prove that it exists,
        and of which we know that reality is even worse.

        This book is for victims and open-minded people.
        It&rsquo;s written in short sentences with simple grammar.
        It&rsquo;s readable for people who are not fluent in English.
        And it has many pictures, cartoons and appendices.
        The main idea of this book is
        that all those gang stalkers
        are a secret society.
        This isn&rsquo;t mentioned in the other books.
        21%-23% of all 11-13 year old Irish children hear voices.
        So there had to be a book that is readable for 10 year old children.

    Early stuff
    &mdash;
    Eleanor White and Norma Cross
    were the first activists
    in the field of gang stalking.
    They didn&rsquo;t treat mobbing
    as a type of gang stalking.
    Their definition of gang stalking
    describes only
    gang stalking by the state.
    This provokes immediately the embarrassing question:
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;Who would want to do this and why?&rdquo;</i>
    and the embarrassing answer:
    <i class="quote">&ldquo;I never heard about this.&rdquo;</i>

This is a difficult text.
It starts with a long history.
The interesting part is in the middle.
Here are some quotes:

<span class="nr">Page 11</span>:

    In the late 1950s,
    a right-wing cadre of men within the new CIA
    was busy building secret armies,
    planning assassinations,
    and generally devising plans for world domination
    that still play out today.

<span class="nr">Page 14</span>:

    Here,
    they describe Nikola Tesla&rsquo;s plans for fantastic weapons.

<span class="nr">Page 15</span>:

    In 1934 Tesla offers to build a
    <span class="nr">Death Ray</span>
    that would make the power of an opponent&rsquo;s air force obsolete.

<span class="nr">Page 25</span>:

    The Russians banned all EMF weapons in 2001.

<span class="nr">Page 26</span>:

    Americans have little idea
    about the research concerning the capabilities of electromagnetism,
    directed acoustics,
    or computer-human interfacing.
    The majority of Americans do not know
    that we are currently using these new-concept weapons
    in Iraq and Afghanistan.

<span class="nr">Page 29</span>:

    Of great concern is the research being conducted at DARPA,
    which is trying to revolutionize
    the way soldiers receive information,
    respond to orders,
    adapt to stress,
    and perform while sleep deprived.

<span class="nr">Page 30</span>:

    In essence,
    Augmented Cognition allows a human to interact
    with a computer through brain waves.
    The idea is to enhance a person&rsquo;s cognitive capabilities
    in the area of memory,
    learning,
    attention,
    visualization,
    and decision-making.

    The increase in human-computer relations

    Dominant Remote Control seeks to control,
    at a distance,
    an enemy&rsquo;s vehicles,
    sensors,
    communications,
    and information systems and manipulate them for military purposes.

<span class="nr">Page 38</span>:

    However,
    hundreds of people continue to assert that a person or persons,
    whom they do not know,
    have been targeting them with electromagnetic weapons

    of either illegal experimentation or outright persecution.

        Feeling sensations of burning,

        Unexpected emotional states,

            An average everyman discovers
            that he&rsquo;s the unwitting target
            of an ultra secret domestic black operation
            which centers on mind control.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lance Bishop is almost shot at his office
            by a self-proclaimed mercy killer,
            who gets shot in time.
            Then his life changes.
            He hears a voice
            that commands him to shoot his wife.
            A detective is killed before his eyes
            with an exotic weapon.
            Then he has his first nervous breakdown.
            At home he finds a CD that was sent by the shooter.
            The shooter was some army psych
            who did mind control research.
            He gives him an address.
            In the middle of the night
            he goes to the address.
            He meets Reggie,
            who shows him a second video message.
            Then the building is stormed
            by a team that collects emotions.
            Before he leaves, he gets a protective cap,
            but he forgets to put it on.
            The people on the street
            are under the influence of the technology.
            He has a second nervous breakdown,
            but he can put the cap on.
            He buys an electronic device to prove the harassment.
            At home he discovers a man with a device
            in the window at the other side of the street.
            He tries to call help,
            but his call is intercepted.
            He discovers that his noisy neighbors
            have been replaced with a tape recorder.
            His wife removes his cap to clean his face.
            He&rsquo;s defenseless against the technology.
            He has a third nervous breakdown.
            Then he shoots his wife.
            But, it was a dummy bullet.
            She starts to behave like an agent and leaves.
            He goes after her.
            He discovers a local control center in the same building.
            His wife knocks him out.
            They wipe his memory.
            His life continues as if nothing happened.
            He has to take medication.
            They irradiate him to impair his memory.
            But, a dish that is glued together
            remembers him of the events.
            When they notice that his memory is back,
            they decide to kill him.
            But, Reggie arrives in time.
            As the agents try to give Lance a heart attack,
            Reggie grabs the gun and shoots an agent.
            Lance and Reggie jump through the windows.
            They fall in a garbage truck.
            Phase 2 starts while they are in a pub:
            mass behavioral modification.
            They will cause civil disturbance.
            Lance and Reggie buy weapons, but, they are robbed.
            The gang is wearing the protective caps
            that they have stolen.
            Suddenly, they are free from the mind control.
            They join Lance and Reggie.
            Lance is discovered because he calls his wife.
            The agents go after him, but his friends shoot them.
            Lance and Reggie torture the team leader.
            He reveals where the control center is: in the hospital.
            He&rsquo;s forced to call for backup.
            Lance kills him with the heart attack weapon.
            He removes his cap.
            Now the agents can easily arrest him
            and bring him to the hospital.
            His wife has been ordered to execute him.
            But, she wants to bring him alive to the Director,
            so he can shoot him.
            Then their son won&rsquo;t have to grow up in hell.
            Lance fails to kill the Director,
            because he appeared as a hologram.

        </p>
        <p>
            This movie was rated the best horror movie of 2005.
            It&rsquo;s about gang stalking because of a hostile divorce.
            Kyle moves to New Jersey because his girlfriend lives there.
            But, Dahlia moves with their daughter Cecilia to New York.
            So it becomes more difficult for Kyle to see his daughter,
            so he sues her.
        </p>
        <p>
            He actually pays stalkers to make her appear insane
            (you see this in scene 1:05:08, see the picture)
            so she will appear unfit to raise the child and lose the trial.
            But, it&rsquo;s a spooky building.
            They don&rsquo;t say it directly,
            but probably an abandoned girl was murdered
            by the landlord and his helper,
            and they dumped her in the water reservoir on top of the building.
            Then strange things happen by leaking water.
            So it&rsquo;s never clear whether the perps are behind it,
            or could it be the spirit of the dead girl.
            Also, they start to hear voices, see the dead girl,
            there&rsquo;s remote body control.
            You see also that Kyle follows the child to school,
            and then it happens there too.
            So the spooky things are caused by Kyle.
            Also, when Dahlia has migraines,
            you hear the sound of ultrasound scans.
            These are references to electronic harassment.
            But you&rsquo;re never sure what is behind it.
            It&rsquo;s a horror movie!

    On September 26, 2012 the bogus group FFCHS placed this billboard in Rhoades.

<p>
    The ad doesn&rsquo;t contain the words
    <span class="zn">gang stalking</span>
    or
    <span class="zn">electronic harassment</span>.
</p>

<p>
    There are 18 words in the ad,
    of which 17 start with a capital letter.
    13 words are on a black background.
    7 words are Italic.
    5 words are in a narrow font.
    So the readability is very low.
</p>

<p>
    So the message is reduced to: call this number.
    But, if you call this number,
    then what?
    Interception of calls is very common.
</p>

<p>
    I designed these better billboards.
    They address the reader directly.

<p>
    This is clear, readable and colorful:

</p>

<p>
    The ad is a letter which is addressed to the president.
    This is very readable, in large white capital letters
    on a black background.
    So it&rsquo;s not addressed to most readers.
    The ad is screaming: don&rsquo;t read me,
    this is for the president.
</p>

<p>
    The letter is Italic.
    So the readability is very low.
</p>

<p>
    The ad doesn&rsquo;t contain the words
    <span class="zn">gang stalking</span>
    or
    <span class="zn">electronic harassment</span>.
</p>

<p>
    At the end of the letter
    the reader learns that he can become the next victim.
</p>

<p>
    It&rsquo;s a waste of advertisement space.
    The letter should have been on a web page.
    Its link should have been in the ad.
    Then there&rsquo;s room for a real ad.
</p>

<p>
    I designed this better ad.
    It&rsquo;s clear, readable and colorful.
    It addresses the reader directly.

    In January 2012 I started
    <span class="schijnlink">www.hearingvoices-is-voicetoskull.com</span>.
    It was meant for people who realize

    <span class="zn">hearing voices</span>.

    I thought that this website would attract
    many people who hear voices.
    But, the information on my website was mainly about gang stalking.
    So it attracted mainly people who knew already what gang stalking is.
    So I changed the plan.
    I started this website.
    The design is completely different:
    it&rsquo;s only one page.
    The first website had many pages,
    one for every subject.
    But, people are used to slow links,
    so they don&rsquo;t follow links anymore.

    Perps wrote a paragraph about gang stalking
    in the Wikipedia article about stalking.
    This paragraph is very negative for the victims.
    It&rsquo;s heavily guarded.
    If you delete it
    then they will revert it
    almost immediately.
    I&rsquo;m sure<sup>[</sup><sup class="label">weasel words</sup><sup>]</sup>
    that they do this to influence the search engine results.
</p>

<p>
    Most people will go to their search engine
    and type

    On June 4, 2013 I saw that
    <span class="zn">Google</span>
    returned 151,000 results
    for
    <span class="zn">gang stalking wiki</span>.

    This was the top of the list:

    I wondered whether I could eventually
    have a better ranking than Wikipedia
    on top of this list.
    Wikipedia is a large site,
    but the word
    <span class="zn">gang</span>
    was only 4 times on the
    <span class="zn">Stalking</span>
    page.
</p>

<p>
    I saw that
    <span class="zn">Google</span>
    returned some of my websites
    as result # 1 when I searched for the words in their name.
</p>

<p>
    So I knew that it was doable,
    especially if I post large texts about
    <span class="zn">gang stalking</span>.
</p>

<p>
    On August 14 I googled
    <span class="zn">gang stalking wiki</span>
    and my site was already hit number 2.
</p>

<p>
    If I add new text to this site,
    then it can temporarily be number 1.

    Wikipedia is not scientific.
    It&rsquo;s not coherent.
    For example,
    on one page
    they wrote
    that Jesus is a historical person.
    On another page
    they wrote
    that Jesus has never existed.
</p>

<p>
    Wikipedia is not neutral.
    It&rsquo;s based on what people say on TV,
    or write in a magazine.
    That&rsquo;s not a good reference.
</p>

<p>
    Wikipedia won&rsquo;t publish a dissenting opinion.
    For example,
    they won&rsquo;t allow that you write about drone attacks
    on a list of terrorist incidents.
    They will rather terminate that article.
</p>

<p>
    Wikipedia deletes all articles
    that are related to gang stalking.

    The 14th century priests burned heretics alive.
    This was
    <span class="zn">logic</span>,
    <span class="zn">rational</span>,
    <span class="zn">reasonable</span>
    and
    <span class="zn">scientific</span>.
    Psychiatry is just the same.
    Poisoning, butchering or electrocuting someone&rsquo;s brain
    is
    <span class="zn">logic</span>,
    <span class="zn">rational</span>,
    <span class="zn">reasonable</span>
    and
    <span class="zn">scientific</span>.
    They believe nonsense.
    They believe it sincerely.
    They become extremely convinced of it.
    They strive forever incessantly
    to make others agree and conform
    to their own ideas and expectations of belief and behavior.
    The religious fanatic and the scientific zealot
    are simple different versions
    of the same nutty phenomenon.
    The content of their assertions and beliefs differ,
    but the manner in which they function is exactly the same.
    In a very real sense
    both the 14th century priest and the modern psychiatrist
    are nothing more than very dull people,
    incapable of calm detached observation of what actually is,
    and who chronically believe and assert very stupid ideas
    that far too many other people readily accept
    without any careful examination or resistance.
    And the funniest part is
    that generally the scientific folks
    attack and claim to be so superior to the religious folks,
    in terms of
    <span class="zn">truth</span>,
    <span class="zn">reason</span>
    and
    <span class="zn">legitimacy</span>
    when they really do exactly the same thing!
    They suffer from the same degree of lunacy
    as did the religious nuts of the past
    which they so correctly criticize and attack.

    Do not base your opinion only on
    what members of the psychiatric field tell you.
    Liquor manufacturers will not tell you
    that their products cause liver damage,
    that they are the source of numerous automobile related deaths every year,
    and encourage you to cease drinking liquor.
    In fact, they will involve themselves and you
    in endless
    <span class="zn">rational</span>
    discussions and
    <span class="zn">reasonable</span>
    arguments
    about
    <span class="zn">responsible partying</span>,
    <span class="zn">drinking with control</span>,
    <span class="zn">designated drivers</span>,
    <span class="zn">take lots of B vitamins</span>
    and so on,
    and do everything but suggest the one and only effective and sensible thing.
    Simply choose not to drink at all and encourage others to do the same.
    Similarly, no psychiatrist will tell you
    that psychiatric procedures harm people
    and that you should avoid them at all cost.
    Even if he or she knew or suspected this,
    he or she couldn&rsquo;t endure the loss of income,
    status and authority this would entail.
    After all, psychiatry is primarily a business.
    It is a money-making venture just like the liquor manufacturers.
    It is not a field ultimately concerned with
    <span class="zn">helping</span>
    people and society.
    Any honest study of its history and practices makes this abundantly clear.
    And again, pay no attention to what they say or claim.
    People can and do believe and say anything,
    and far too often what they say and believe has nothing at all to do
    with
    <span class="zn">truth</span>
    or your best interests.

    The mental health community aids in repression
    by directly diagnosing
    and even institutionalizing against their will
    people who claim to be mind control victims.
    This is nothing short
    of the former Soviet system
    of using psychiatry
    to discredit and silence dissidents and others.
    There really are mentally ill people,
    and their illnesses are used as cover lies for torture.
    The mental health system should be considered
    collaborators in repression,
    at least until their diagnostic manuals have entries
    for electronic and other mind control,
    nonconsensual experimentation,
    and trauma and torture sequelae
    due to harassment campaigns.
    The psychiatric community is used
    to enforce belief
    in the socially demanded delusion
    that the government does not engage
    in extrajudicial torture and harassment
    of its own citizens
    (and the delusion
    that the psychiatric community
    doesn&rsquo;t have years of mind control blood on its hands).
</p>

<p>
    The psychiatric and psychological communities
    are also used
    as tools in the repression and torture.
    Sometimes wittingly,
    sometimes unwittingly,
    mental health workers aid in and help cover up
    mind control operations.
    First, these communities aid in the repression
    by advertising mental illnesses and their symptoms
    while ignoring technological means
    for inflicting the same symptoms.
    They ignore the reality
    of government harassment campaigns
    and nonconsensual experimentation
    on the public.
    This lays the groundwork for mind control victims
    to be labeled as mentally ill
    and dismissed,
    or for some half-educated person
    to think
    that they are helping
    by suggesting
    that the victim
    <i class="quote">get psychiatric help.</i>
    Deniability is one of the first principles
    of covert action,
    and inflicting torture
    which mimics the symptoms of mental illness
    is not especially novel.
    The deniability is preserved
    by publicizing mental illnesses
    while denying mind control technology
    and harassment techniques.

<p>
    Before you start to read websites about gang stalking
    you should realize that
    disinfo is a very important part of gang stalking.
    Victims create websites,
    forums, books, videos, MP3&rsquo;s and so on
    to spread their ideas.
    Gang stalkers will use the same means
    to spread their own distorted version of the truth.
    They know government and the press so well
    that they can present their material
    so if government or the press want to read something about gang stalking
    then they will choose something that was made by gang stalkers,
    and if they want to invite a speaker,
    then they will invite a gang stalker.
</p>

<p>
    Gang stalkers will always try
    to suppress the truth about gang stalking.
    But, if the word gets out,
    then gang stalkers will make it sound as crazy as possible.
</p>

<p>
    Typically,
    if you believe that
    you are being stalked by several people,
    then you will have great difficulty
    to say this on TV.
    But, if they say something about mind control on TV,
    then they invite Magnus Olsson
    with his strange stories
    about nano implants.

    156 sites have a registered domain name (about 46 %).
</p>

<p>
    About 1 in 5 victims makes a website.
</p>

<p>
    If the number of aware victims grows
    at the same rate
    as the number of gang stalking websites,
    then we can predict the number of aware victims:

<p>
    This calculation was based
    on the observation
    that the number of gang stalking websites
    grew with 0.22% per day
    during 24 weeks.
</p>

<p>
    The following calculation shows a simulation
    of aware victims between 1993 to 2013.
    Their number grew with 0.057% per day.

        Test your website

        because it can show up differently.

        If you make a complex website
        and you translate it completely
        into several languages,
        then it becomes nightmarish to update it.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is tempting
        to make
        <span class="zn">URL</span>s

        <span class="zn">JavaScript</span>.
        Such links cannot be checked.
        They are not spidered.

        I made several websites with

        applets.
        I always had to remove the applets.
    </li>
    <li>
        I always had to remove the frames.
        When people use a search engine,
        they can arrive in a frame.
        If you link to the rest of your site in a frame,
        then that page will appear inside the frame,
        except if you use
        <pre>target="_parent"</pre>
        or
        <pre>target="_top"</pre>.

        If your document will be displayed at x %,
        and you change the resolution
        of your pictures to 72.27 * x %
        without resampling (scaling),
        then they should appear in
        <span class="zn">Reader</span>
        like in your graphics program at 100%.
        I tried that
        with several text processors
        and PDF writers.
        The chance that every picture
        will appear correctly
        is very small.

        Use a link checker.
    </li>
    <li>
        The names should be shorter than 32 characters
        so they won&rsquo;t give trouble
        when they are copied to a
        <span class="zn">Classic Macintosh</span>.

                A simple 16x16 icon

    The goal is that every picture appears everywhere
    with the right colors.
    For example,
    if a picture has been made by a scanner or camera,

    and the
    <span class="zn">color profile</span>
    of the monitor or printer.
    Special software like
    <span class="zn">ColorSync</span>
    will adapt the colors of the picture.
    The
    <span class="zn">color profile</span>
    can be embedded in the picture.

        and then your pictures are typically too dark.
        These programs come like an affliction,
        but they are capable of shredding all your pictures.
    </li>
    <li>
        When you don&rsquo;t use
        <span class="zn">color management</span>,
        and you open a picture with an embedded
        <span class="zn">color profile</span>
        then it appears with &lsquo;incorrect&rsquo; colors.
        But, if you save it as a picture without embedded
        <span class="zn">color profile</span>
        then the colors can be automatically converted
        to fit the
        <span class="zn">color profile</span>.
        This means that the colors of your picture are &lsquo;correct,&rsquo;
        but possibly not what you wanted,
        because it can be different from what you saw on screen.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you convert a picture,
        then you should always compare
        the result to the original.
    </li>
    <li>
        When you change the

        the colors that you measure on screen.

<p>
    <span class="zn">Color reduction</span>
    is changing the bit depth of the picture
    from 32 bit to 16, 8, 4, 2 or 1 bit.
    Some programs allow you to choose exactly how many colors you want to use.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <span class="zn">GraphicConverter</span>
        can automatically dither during color reduction.
        You can disable this in the
        <span class="zn">Options</span>
        menu in the
        <span class="zn">Colors</span>
        item of the
        <span class="zn">Picture</span>
        menu.
    </li>
    <li>
        The
        <span class="zn">color table</span>
        of a picture with indexed colors like
        <span class="zn">GIF</span>
        can be minimized.
        This means that pixels with the same color
        have the same index,
        and every color appears only once
        in the color table.
        This creates a smaller file.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you change from X colors to Y colors
        but you used no more than Y colors,
        then your colors remain unchanged.
        Otherwise, your colors are changed.
        So when you save as a
        <span class="zn">GIF</span>
        then you should compare
        the result to the original.
        Especially when you reduce to 4 colors,
        the colors can be unacceptable.
    </li>
    <li>
        Some servers don&rsquo;t accept
        <span class="zn">GIF</span>s
        with a particular bit depth.
        So if you upload a
        <span class="zn">GIF</span>
        and you get an error,
        then it could be the bit depth.

<p>
    You can create an unprotected folder

    For example,
    you can put here a

    which contains links to your websites.
    This file will be copied by websites
    which collect
    <span class="zn">PDF</span>

    They display these files on their website.
    This creates a link

                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Direct links?
                <ul>
                    <li>Do you know people who will place a link to your website on their website?</li>
                    <li>Which chance do you make that someone will place a link to your website on his website?</li>

<p>
    Thus far,
    the best way of action
    was to publish text and images
    on a website.
</p>

<p>
    In my opinion,
    your own webspace
    with a registered domain name
    is the best choice.
    I have had several blogs and forums
    and I really wouldn&rsquo;t reconsider.
</p>

<h3><a class="h2" name="Blogs">Blogs</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="Media/Images/Style/Edit.gif" width="29" height="13" alt="[edit]" border="0"></h3>

<p>
    Advantages:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        They are hosted on a website
        with a high page ranking.
    </li>
    <li>
        They have often a calendar
        that creates automatic pages
        that are indexed by search engines.
    </li>
    <li>
        They are often on top
        of search engine results.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Disadvantages:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        They have terrible names.
        <span class="schijnlink">gangstalkingwiki.wordpress.com</span>
        would have been a bad name for this website.
    </li>
    <li>
        They can be too modern,
        so they cannot be viewed
        on an old computer.
        Blog pages can often not be viewed
        on a
        <span class="zn">Classic Macintosh</span>
        because such a computer has a limited memory.
    </li>
    <li>
        They can be difficult to remove.
    </li>
    <li>
        They are not suitable for teaching someone what gang stalking is.
    </li>
    <li>
        A website with dynamic pages
        that take some time to load
        will discourage readers
        to follow the links on your website.
    </li>
    <li>
        Most people won&rsquo;t publish
        links to blogs
        on their site.
    </li>
    <li>
        Don&rsquo;t take it for granted
        that large websites like
        <span class="zn">blogger</span>
        and
        <span class="zn">wordpress</span>
        will be online forever.
        They might disappear,
        but they can also change their name.
        For example,
        <span class="schijnlink">www.uploadingit.com</span>
        changed into
        <span class="schijnlink">www.firefile.io</span>
        so you see that it can happen.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    So your first impression
    will be that your blog is a success,
    because its importance is overrated.
    But after a while you will be disappointed
    because people don&rsquo;t create links to your blog
    so its success will be limited.
</p>

<p>
    If you have a hobby,
    for example, you do sports competition,
    and you would like
    that your fans can follow
    your recent activity,
    then a blog is OK.

<h3><a class="h2" name="Forums">Forums</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="Media/Images/Style/Edit.gif" width="29" height="13" alt="[edit]" border="0"></h3>

<p>
    Advantages:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        They are hosted on a website
        with a high page ranking.
    </li>
    <li>
        They create automatic pages
        with subforums
        and 10 messages per page.
        All these pages are indexed by search engines.
        They are often on top
        of search engine results.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Disadvantages:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        They can be swarmed by perps,
        with only perps posting.
    </li>
    <li>
        They can display ads on top,
        at the bottom
        and in the middle
        of every page.
    </li>
    <li>
        It can cost much time
        to patrol the forum.
    </li>
    <li>
        As I could see between 2008 and 2013,
        people come to a forum only
        if it were created by an organization like
        <span class="zn">FEDAME</span>
        or
        <span class="zn">FFCHS</span>.
        A registered domain name
        makes no difference.
    </li>
</ol>


<h3><a class="h2" name="Hosting">Hosting</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="Media/Images/Style/Edit.gif" width="29" height="13" alt="[edit]" border="0"></h3>

<p>
    The best way to put your website online,
    is a registered domain name with free web space.
    You make text files with the extension htm.
    Then you use FTP to upload.
</p>

<p>
    If you wish, then you can still add
    a blog or a forum to such a website.
    This is better than a free blog or forum
    because there are no ads,
    and you are completely in control.
    But, this can cost much bandwidth.
    They might charge you for it.
</p>

<p>
    When you register a domain name,
    then many websites will publish
    <i class="quote">&lsquo;interesting&rsquo;</i>
    data
    about your website.
    So they create links to your website.
    (Sometimes they will propose to remove
    <i class="quote">&lsquo;interesting&rsquo;</i>
    data
    like your email address
    if you are willing to pay.)
</p>

<p>
    Choose a name that is descriptive
    and that contains the word
    <span class="zn">gang stalking</span>
    and that ends with
    <span class="zn">.com</span>.
    A <span class="zn">.com</span> is always the best choice.
</p>

<p>
    Examples:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        If your name is
        <span class="zn">Liz</span>,
        and you&rsquo;re being stalked in
        <span class="zn">Springfield</span>
        then
        <span class="schijnlink">www.GangStalkingLizInSpringfield.com</span>
        is a good name.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you want to explain gang stalking
        then
        <span class="schijnlink">www.GangStalkingExplained.com</span>
        is a good name.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you want to network with other victims in
        <span class="zn">Florida</span>
        then
        <span class="schijnlink">www.GangStalkingInFlorida.com</span>
        is a good name.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Some words will result in a better score in the
    <span class="zn">Google</span>
    results. For example:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="schijnlink">www.EncyclopediaOfGangStalking.com</span></li>
    <li><span class="schijnlink">www.FreemasonGangStalking.com</span></li>

    <li><span class="schijnlink">www.GangStalkingBusiness.com</span></li>
    <li><span class="schijnlink">www.GangStalkingCrimes.com</span></li>
    <li><span class="schijnlink">www.GangStalkingDeals.com</span></li>

<p>
    The best design for a website
    is hierarchical.
</p>



<h2><a class="h2" name="Statistics">Statistics</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="Media/Images/Style/Edit.gif" width="29" height="13" alt="[edit]" border="0"></h2>

<p>
    Visitor statistics have to be interpreted correctly.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Many visitors are spiders or robots
        (like search engines).
    </li>
    <li>
        Many visitors are referer spam.
        They request a file from your website
        with an extra line to the request
        that contains a link to the website
        that they want to promote.
        This is recorded in the visitor statistics.
        Many websites display these statistics.
        Such pages are spidered by search engines.
        This makes the promoted website more important.
    </li>
</ol>


<h2><a class="h2" name="Promotion">Promotion</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="Media/Images/Style/Edit.gif" width="29" height="13" alt="[edit]" border="0"></h2>

<p>
    A website doesn&rsquo;t make sense
    if it has no visitors.
</p>

<p>
    Here are some strategies:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Make the website that you want to promote.
        Then make a second website.
        This uses a script to replace its home page
        with the home page of your first website.
        Now copy all the websites about gang stalking
        that you can find
        and add those pages to your second website.
        The second website will get a high page ranking,
        so your first website will get a high page ranking too.
        This worked reasonably well for Eleanor White.
    </li>
    <li>
        A website with a specific message
        will attract readers who search
        that specific information.
        For example,
        if you write that you do body building competition
        and you experience harassment in this body building world
        then this will attract readers who search
        information about harassment in the body building world.
        Then you could have more readers
        than when you write about gang stalking in general
        on a small website
        with a low ranking
        that people never find.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create many websites
        with many pages.
        Create links to all your websites
        on every page.
        Write big words like
        God, sex, and Nazis on every page
        and post large random photographs.
        This will fool search engines
        and make them believe
        that your websites are
        <i class="quote">&ldquo;important.&rdquo;</i>
        Then your websites have a good chance
        of appearing on top of the search results.
        This is the strategy of Benjamin Simon.
        It works, although it&rsquo;s total trash.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create several forums
        which mirror their messages.
        Every page has a link to all forums.
        This technique is called incest.
        This works well for
        <a href="http://www.bilderberg.org" target="blank">www.bilderberg.org</a>
        and
        <a href="http://www.politics.be" target="blank">www.politics.be</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Advertize your website with
        <span class="zn">Google</span>
        ads.
        It works for
        <a href="http://www.DataAsylum.com" target="blank">www.DataAsylum.com</a>,
        although it&rsquo;s lunatic drivel and disinfo.
    </li>
    <li>
        Visit many websites and forums.
        Post a
        <i class="quote">&ldquo;What is gang stalking&rdquo;</i>
        article with a link to your website.
        This works well for
        <a href="http://www.GangStalkingWorld.com" target="blank">www.GangStalkingWorld.com</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Copy the information from John Finch.
        Add a link to your website.
        Send it to all email addresses that you can find.
        Many people will post this information
        on their website.
        This creates a link to your website.
    </li>
    <li>
        Referer spam.
    </li>
    <li>
        Say that you are an
        <i class="quote">&ldquo;organization.&rdquo;</i>
        Many people will post a link to your website.
        This works well for
        <a href="http://www.ICAACT.org" target="blank">www.ICAACT.org</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        The strategy of this website
        is that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" target="blank">en.wikipedia.org</a>
        is a bad name
        that is difficult to type
        and difficult to remember
        so people type
        <span class="zn">gang stalking wiki</span>
        in their search engine
        instead of typing
        <span class="zn">gang stalking</span>
        in
        <span class="zn">wikipedia</span>.
