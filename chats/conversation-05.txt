I know this may be a topic that is done to death on YouTube, but I don't see much of it discussed on the deep web, and that's the Illuminati influence in pop culture. Its been there for decades, but now its so blatant and in your face that the kids just joke around about it ("Look its a pyramid! Illuminati!") because they're so desensitized.

The basic stuff, like the hand gestures and visuals/graphics, you see everywhere. Music videos, sports arenas, movies, commercials, you name it. Hell, they just ran a Hyundai commercial with a dad and his daughter in the car, and the dad starts asking the onboard Siri-like computer random questions, and one of them is "What is the Illuminati?" Its everywhere. Watch any modern example of the media I listed above, and you'll see lots of examples of:
- One-Eye (either holding a hand over one eye or placing hair in front of it)
- Pyramids (usually just regular pyramids but sometimes with the eye at the top)
- "Shh" (placing the finger over the lips to say "shh, don't tell our secret")
- Girls in tiger/cheetah print (this represents the Beta Kitten programming that a lot of starlets go through, via their exposure to MK Ultra mind control experiments)
- Upside down crosses and upside down five-pointed stars

I am of the belief that the powers that be are heavily connected to and involved in the occult, Gnosticism, and Satanism, and want to mold the world based around their sick and twisted thoughts. These are the guys that visit the Red Rooms, if they're real. The high-level elite, who people would refer to as the Illuminati, a great number of them have literally fucked small children in broad daylight, with several armed guards at the door. I mean these are the worst kind of people.

So my question is this, when does it all come to a head? What kind of world are we going to be living in, in say 50 years? I mean, think of it like this, we are all on the deep web right now, we know there are some SICK ass people here, do you think those people will ever have their day? Will the dirty pedos and murderers ever have their day to come out of the shadows and commit these heinous acts with no outside interference? Are the Illuminati creating Hell on Earth, in the hopes of conjuring up their buddy Satan?

Share your thoughts.





What I can't help but notice is how the Illuminati is basically a trend at this point. It's cool, it's hip, it's popular. It's mentioned in songs by popular artists (look up Madonna's song "Illuminati," or Rick Ross' "Freemason") and is generally looked at favorably by the general masses. I worked at a Chipotle for a while, and I saw so many people from ages 18-24 (I'm 30 now) come in with tattoos and t-shirts with the all-seeing eye. Hell I even saw a guy with hipster ear gauges and a massive Freemason square-and-compass tattoo on his chest. The symbolism is blatant in some cases, and subtle in others, like a t-shirt of the band Mastodon that has a square-and-compass hidden in the background. Miley Cyrus puts on concerts for teenagers with massive all-seeing eyes and pyramids all over the stage, fucking Doritos made a commercial about the "Illuminacho." I mean what the fuck? How are there still people that deny this shit exists? The most common dismissal that I hear is "oh that's just a bunch of celebrities/high rollers/rich elite who get together and party. They have no part in my daily life." That's the wall that is almost impossible to break with most people, because admitting that a Satanic cabal makes decisions that impacts their life would completely tear down their worldview and drive many people mad. I mean, there are people who, if they had irrefutable proof that ritualistic sacrifice still went on behind closed doors in 2015 (at places like Bohemian Grove), they would literally lose their mind rather than accept it as truth.

I am interested to see how the world will change as the Illuminati becomes more and more popular. If you are not familiar with the phrase "the externalization of the hierarchy," look it up. That is what is happening. The basic premise is that the "secret controllers" are slowly but surely leaking bits and pieces of the "New World Order" into society, so after another fifty or so years, there will have been so many small, tiny changes in society, that no one will stop and notice just how much things have actually changed. Like the Bible says: "The hearts of men will grow cold."

What kind of world do you guys think we'll be living in after another fifty or so years of these secret societies pushing their influence into society?



Illuminati are just creation of God, to bring correction for some problem. In my opinion, correction was made long time ago and they are in "zomby state" driven by Ego, NOT Love(very important information).
They are bringing great destruction. Luckily, there is good resistance. I know their souls better than they know them themselves, what they do is set to fail, but not without great damage infected upon globe.
Maybe as introduction, you could start reading what Svali has to say...
