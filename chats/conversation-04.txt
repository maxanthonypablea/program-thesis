I have personally looked a lot in to the matter of this group, and have found many information about themselves and their plans as well as many information about their origin. Like you said the modern form of the Illuminati was formed during the 18th century A.D. in Babaria (Germany) , and was called babarian illuminati. Like you again said mankind was always keen in to keeping secrets and countless of organizations have been created in order to protect and keep this kind of knowledge. Now history is an other really interesting subject as I am a history enthusiast my self and especially with the Dark ages. History though is a lie. I do not advocate nothing we learn is real, but more than 50% has been altered in order to conceal or promote certain ideologys,political figures etc , in order to benefit the few. It is just an other means of mind control and manipulation of our brain in order to have certain ideologys and beliefs. Now I am a Christian myself, but I find really interesting certain religions and ancient Gods as you mentioned above. Many times certain thoughts trouble me like why would so powerful and enlightened men (not talking only about the Iluminati) warship such gods. Then there is the other opinion which is that practically they are war shipping the devil and he is their source of power. The fallen angel tries to control earth and in order to do so he must find his representatives who will be his eyes and ears in exchange of his powers. Now these gods you are talking about are who? Jeus and the Ancient Greek Gods? Ra and the ancient Egyptian gods?


Now,


"I believe that these people have had ancient alien technology that surpasses anything we could fathom today, and they've had it for centuries/millennia. This is speculation on my part but it's the only thing that can explain what I have found about them. Either that or they really have an ancient God working on their side and I refuse to believe that."
You said "it's the only thing that can explain what I have found about them.".
What are you referring at? What could you have found in order for you to think the only way of them being able to do that is with the intervention of such a being?


I would be really interested in hearing more from you.

Thanks for replying NJF,
Yes i am well schooled in all the relative knowledge to do with the elite and their tools to keep us suppressed, i have being researching them for a number of years now. I am "Awake"
And yes i am aware of the calcification of the pineal gland from ingesting fluoride, and i am actually an anti-fluoride campainer in my country.
Unfortunately Fluoride is not only put in the U.S water supply but in a few more countries like Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Republic of ireland, United kingdom, and serbia off the top of my head.
I purposely do not drink fluorde and use fluoride free toothpaste because of its negative effects on the pineal gland. The pineal gland being responsible for deep thought/thinking; and as a doorway into other worlds/dimensions, if we learn how to use it properly unimaginable things are possible.
I have been an activist against the 1% for a number of years and can tell people all about haarp; chemtrails; trilateral commision; bildeberg group; council on foreign relations; bavarian illuminati etc etc just to name a few.
I have also delved into multi dimensional universe thories and vibrations/wave lengths etc but cannot find the information im searching for yet.
As for Fibonacci i havnt done as much research on thhe code as much as i would have liked and I think you may be on to somthing there as i am aware that everything in the universe goes by that code or something along those lines, i will do some research on that and the "golden cut".... thanks
I still think there is information out there even us conspracy factists/researchers/activists have not found yet because they are still in control and have the masses "by the balls"
When this information is found the person will have 2 choices: use it for good or turn green like the rest of them as we all suffer from the human condition.
Thanks for the info NJF I will be looking more into fibonacci and the "golden cut" i was planning to a while back but forgot about it.
